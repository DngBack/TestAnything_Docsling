## THE EV (Electric Vehicle) SYSTEM

The LEAF is an electric vehicle. Some of the vehicle's systems operate differently and have different operating characteristics than vehicles equipped with an internal combustion engine. It is important to carefully review the entire owner's manual for this reason. The main difference is the LEAF is powered by electricity.The LEAF does not require and it is not capable of using gasoline like a vehicle powered by a traditional internal combustion engine.The LEAF uses electricity stored in the lithium ion (Li-ion) battery. The vehicle's Li-ion battery must be charged with electricity before the vehicle can be driven. As the vehicle operates, the Li-ion battery gradually discharges. If theLi-ion battery becomes completely discharged, the vehicle will not operate until it is re-charged.

This vehicle uses two types of batteries. One is the 12-volt battery that is the same as the battery in vehicles powered by gasoline engines, the other is the Li-ion battery (high voltage).

The 12-volt battery provides power to the vehicle systems and features such as the audio system, supplemental restraint systems, headlights and windshield wipers.

## WARNING

Your vehicle contains a sealed Li-ion high voltage battery. If the Li-ion batteryisdisposedofimproperly,thereisa risk of severe burns and electrical shock that may result in serious injury or death and there is also a risk of environmental damage.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

To prevent damage to the Li-ion battery:

- · Donotexposethevehicletoextreme ambient temperatures for extended periods.
- · Do not store the vehicle in temperatures below -13°F (-25°C) for more than seven days.
- · Do not leave the vehicle for more than14dayswheretheLi-ionbattery available charge gauge reaches a zero or near zero.
- · Do not use the Li-ion battery for any other purpose.

The Li-ion battery provides power to the electric motor (traction motor) that moves the vehicle.

The Li-ion battery also charges the 12-volt battery.

The vehicle must be plugged in for the Li-ion battery to be charged. Additionally, the vehicle system can extend the vehicle range by converting driving force into electricity that is stored in the Li-ion battery while the vehicle is decelerating or being driven downhill. This is called regenerative braking. This vehicle is considered to be an environmentally friendly vehicle because it does not emit exhaust gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

## NOTE:

- · If the outside temperature is -13°F (-25°C) or less, the Li-ion battery may freeze and it cannot be charged or provide power to run the vehicle. Move the vehicle to a warm location.
- · The capacity of the Li-ion battery in your vehicle to hold a charge will, like all such batteries, decrease with time and usage. As the battery ages and capacity decreases, this will result in a decreasefromthevehicle'sinitial mileage range. This is normal, expected, andnotindicative of any defect in your Li-ion battery.
- · The Li-ion battery has limited service life, and when its charging capacity falls below a specific level, the EV system warning light will illuminate. Owners should bring their vehicle in for inspection and possible battery replacement.
- · It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for information about recycling or disposal of the Li-ion battery. Do not attempt to recycle or dispose of the Li-ion battery yourself.

## DRIVING WITH A DISCHARGED LI-ION BATTERY

When a destination is set in the navigation system (if so equipped) that exceeds the available vehicle range, the navigation system automatically searches the location of nearby charging stations. When the nearby charging station locations are displayed, charge the Li-ion battery as soon as possible.

Warning lights illuminate on the instrument panel and messages are displayed on the vehicle information display to inform you that the Li-ion battery charge is low. Instructions are also displayed on the navigation system screen (if so equipped) to direct you to nearby charging stations.

The vehicle's range is very limited when these warning lights illuminate and messages are displayed. Follow the instructions on the navigation system screen (if so equipped) and immediately charge the vehicle at the nearest charging station.

There are three levels of information that will be displayed as the Li-ion battery becomes discharged:

<!-- image -->

- 1. The following warning lights illuminate on the instrument panel and messages are displayed on the vehicle information display at the same time to indicate low Li-ion battery charge:
- · Thelowbatterychargeindicator

## NOTE:

Due to traffic conditions, it may be difficult to get to the charging station suggested by the navigation system (if so equipped). If the Li-ion battery is almost completely discharged, drive directly to the nearest charging station.

- 2. If the vehicle is driven and the Li-ion battery continues to discharge, the driving range on the instrument panel changes to '- - -' O 2 .
- Messages are displayed on the navigation system screen (if so equipped). For additional information, see 'Li-ion battery available charge gauge' (P. 2-9).
- 3. When the power limitation indicator light illuminates, traction motor output is limited resulting in reduced vehicle speed. Stop the vehicle in a safe location before the Li-ion battery becomes completely discharged and there

is no power available to drive the vehicle. Contact Roadside Assistance Service shown in your NISSAN Warranty Information Booklet. For additional information, see 'If the Li-ion battery becomes completely discharged' (P. 6-12).

## CHARGING THE 12-VOLT BATTERY

The 12-volt battery is charged automatically using electricity stored in the Li-ion battery.

When the 12-volt battery is being charged, the charge status indicator light on the instrument panel flashes (except when charging the Li-ion battery or the power switch is in the READY to drive position). For additional information, see 'Charging status indicator lights' (P. CH-50).

## While vehicle is driven

The Li-ion battery charges the 12-volt battery as necessary when the power switch is in the READY to drive position.

The 12-volt battery is not charged in the following conditions.

- · When the power switch is in the ACC position.
- · When the power switch is in the ON position and the shift position is in the N (Neutral) position.

## While the vehicle is not in use

When the EV system is off for an extended time, the 12-volt battery may be automatically charged for a short period of time on a regular basis.

## LI-ION BATTERY WARMER (if so equipped)

## For models with 40 kWh battery

To avoid personal injury, never touch high-voltage wiring, connectors, and other highvoltage parts, such as inverter unit and Li-ion battery. An electric shock may occur if exposed electric wires are visible when viewed from inside or outside of your vehicle. Therefore, never touch exposed electric wires.
- · If the vehicle receives a strong impact to the floor while driving, stop the vehicle in a safe location and check the floor.
- · Leaks or damage to the Li-ion battery may result in a fire. If you discover them, contact emergency services immediately. Since the fluid leak maybelithiummanganatefrom the Li-ion battery, never touch the fluid leak inside or outside the vehicle. If the fluid contacts your skin or eyes, wash it off immediately with a large amount of water and receive immediate medical attention to help avoid serious injury.
- · If a fire occurs in the EV, leave the vehicle as soon as possible. Only use a type ABC, BC or C fire extinguisher that is meant for use on electrical fires. Using a small amount of water or the incorrect fire extinguisher can result in serious injury or death from electrical shock.
- · If your vehicle needs to be towed, do it with the front wheels raised. If the front wheels are on the ground when towing, the traction motor may generate electricity. This may damage the components of the EV system and cause a fire.
- · If you are not able to safely assess thevehicleduetovehicledamage,do not touch the vehicle. Leave the vehicle and contact emergency services. Advise first responders that this is an electric vehicle.
- · In the event of an accident that requires body repair and painting, the Li-ion battery pack and high voltage parts such as the inverter, including the wire harness, should be removed prior to painting. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service. Li-ion battery packs exposed to heat in the paint booth will experience capacity loss. Damaged Li-ion battery packs may also pose safety risks to untrained mechanics and repair personnel.

## EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF SYSTEM

The emergency shut-off system is activated and the high-voltage system automatically turns off in the following conditions:

- - Front and side collisions in which the air bags are deployed.
- - Certain rear collisions.
- - Certain EV system malfunctions.

For the above collisions and certain other EVsystemmalfunctions,theREADYtodrive indicator light will turn off. For additional information, see 'Warning lights, indicator lights and audible reminders' (P. 2-14).

The emergency shut-off activates for the above collisions to minimize risk of an event that could cause injury or an accident. If the emergency shut-off system activates, the EV system may not be switched to the READY to drive position; it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer. Even if the power switch is switched to the READY to drive position, the system may shut-off suddenly. Therefore, drive cautiously to the nearest certified repair facility; it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for service.

## EVCHARACTERISTICS

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Pay special attention to pedestrians. Becausethere is no engine noise, pedestrians may not know the vehicle is approaching, moving or about to move, and may step into the path of vehicle travel.
- · When leaving the vehicle, be sure to turn off the EV system.
- · Be sure to push the P (Park) position switch on the shift lever and apply the parking brake when parking becausethevehiclecanmovewhenthe READY to drive indicator light is ON. When the READY to drive indicator light is ON, do not leave your vehicle in a shift position other than the P (Park) position.
- · Keepthebrakepedaldepresseduntil you are ready to drive. When the vehicle is in the D (Drive) position, B or R (Reverse) position, if you release the brake pedal and do not depress the accelerator, the vehicle will creep and may start abruptly. This may cause serious injury or death.

## NOTE:

- · The vehicle cannot run with a discharged Li-ion battery. Repeated acceleration consumes more power from the Li-ion battery than driving at a steady speed.
- · This vehicle is equipped with a regenerative brake system.The primary purpose of the regenerative brake system is to provide some power to recharge the Li-ion battery and extend driving range. A secondary benefit is 'engine braking' that operates based on Li-ion battery conditions.
- · In the D (Drive) position, when the accelerator pedal is released, the regenerative brake system provides some deceleration.
- · When you put the shift lever in the B mode and take your foot off the accelerator pedal, more regenerative brake is applied than in the D (Drive) position.
- · Less deceleration is provided by the regenerative brake system when the Liion battery is fully charged. The regenerative brake is automatically reduced whentheLi-ionbatteryisfullycharged to prevent the Li-ion battery from becomingovercharged.The regenerative brake is also automatically reduced when the battery temperature is high/ low (indicated by the red/blue zones on the Li-ion battery temperature gauge) to prevent Li-ion battery damage.
- · Thebrakepedalshouldbeusedtoslow orstopthevehicledependingontraffic or road conditions. The vehicle brakes are not affected by the regenerative brake system operation.

## NOISE AND VIBRATION

You might experience the following noise or vibration as a normal characteristic of this vehicle:

- · Traction motor noise from the motor compartment.
- · Water pump and radiator fan noise while charging.
- · Compressorandradiator fan noise when the Climate Ctrl. Timer or remote climate control (models with Navigation System) is used.

<!-- image -->

## CHECKING LI-ION BATTERY CHARGING STATUS

The Li-ion battery charge status can be checked on the NISSAN Data Center website via an internet enabled smart phone or personal computer.

If the Li-ion battery is not sufficiently charged, you can start charging the Li-ion battery via the remote charge function. For additional information, see 'Charging related remote function' (P. CH-49).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## OPERATING THE CLIMATE CONTROL SYSTEM BEFORE DRIVING

The vehicle's heating and air conditioning system can be turned on via remote control with an internet enabled smart phone or personal computer.

This allows the interior of the vehicle to be heatedorcooledwhilethevehicleischarging. This reduces the load on the Li-ion battery while the vehicle is being driven and can help increase the vehicle driving range. For additional information, see 'Remote climate control' (P. 4-41).

## Notification of the Li-ion battery warmer operation (if so equipped)

You can be notified with the status of the Li-ion battery warmer operation on the NISSAN Data Center website via an internet enabledsmartphoneorpersonalcomputer.

When the power switch is in the OFF position and the charge connector is not connected, if the Li-ion battery warmer starts or stops, it notifies you to connect the charger to the vehicle.

<!-- image -->

STARTING YOUR VEHICLE

<!-- image -->

- 1. Depress the brake pedal O 1 .

- 2. Push the power switch O 2 .
- 3. Check that the READY to drive indicator light O 3 illuminates. For additional information, see 'READY to drive indicator light' (P. 2-25).
- 4. For models with Navigation System: If route guidance is necessary, enter the destination in the navigation system. For additional information, refer to the NissanConnect® Manual.
- 5. Check the Li-ion battery level and the estimated driving range shown on the meter. For additional information, see 'Driving range' (P. 2-9).

## NOTE:

- · For additional information, see 'Driving range'(P. 2-9).
- · Before driving, compare the driving distance to the destination displayed on the navigation system screen (if so equipped) with the estimated driving range shown on the meter. Determine if it will be necessary to charge the Liion battery before or while driving to your planned destination.
- · If it is necessary to charge the Li-ion battery, use the navigation system (if so equipped)tosearchforavailablecharging stations on your planned driving route.

<!-- image -->

## DRIVING THE VEHICLE

- 1. Depress the brake pedal O 1 .
- 2. Release the parking brake O 2 .
- 3. Move the shift lever O 3 into the D (Drive) position. When released, the shift lever returns to its original center position.

- 5. Release the brake pedal.
- 6. Depress the accelerator pedal and start driving.

<!-- image -->

These are the following gear positions for driving the vehicle forward:

- · Use the D (Drive) position for optimum driving performance.
- · Use the B mode for downhill driving. When the B mode is used, more regenerative brake is applied when the accelerator pedal is released in comparison to the D (Drive) position.

For additional information, see 'Driving the vehicle' (P. 5-14).

## NOTE:

The regenerative brake converts the vehicle's forward motion to electric power to help slow the vehicle.

Use the ECO mode for maximum vehicle range and for city driving. The ECO mode helps reduce power consumption by reducing acceleration when compared to the same accelerator pedal position in the D (Drive) position (normal mode).

<!-- image -->

If the low battery charge indicator illuminates yellow,the Li-ion battery charge is too low for travel. For additional information, see "Li-ion battery available charge gauge" (P. 2-9). Charge the Li-ion battery as soon as possible.

- 3. Connect the charge connector to the vehicle.
- 4. When the charging timer is turned on, chargingstartsatthesettime.Whenthe charging timer is not turned on, charging starts immediately.

## NOTE:

- · Chargingcanbestartedremotely,even if the charging timer is set up.
- · When you have forgotten to connect thechargeconnectorathome,thereisa function that can notify you via a text message capable cellular phone, internet enabled smart phone or personal computer. For additional information, see 'Charging related remote function' (P. CH-49) (models with Navigation System).
- · NISSAN recommends that you connect the normal charge cable when getting out of the vehicle, even if it is not going to be used. By doing this, you can get the most out of the remote climate control (models with Navigation System) and Climate Ctrl. Timer functions the next time you use the vehicle.

## EFFICIENT USE OF YOUR VEHICLE

## RANGE

The distance you can drive the vehicle (range) varies considerably depending upon available charge, weather, temperature, usage, battery age, topography, and driving style.

Refer to the Monroney label (window sticker) for the official EPA range. Your actual range will vary and could be significantly less, either initially or as the battery ages and with use over time. For additional information, see 'Improve driving range' (P. EV-22) for information on the factors that affect vehicle range and how to use the vehicle to maximize vehicle range.

## IMPROVE DRIVING RANGE

Vehicle range depends on a number of factors.

Actual vehicle range will vary depending upon:

- · Speed,
- · Vehicle load,
- · Electrical load from vehicle accessories,
- · Traffic and road conditions,
- · Distance driven without stopping,
- · Usage,

- · Driving style,
- · Battery age,
- · Weather or temperature,
- · Topography,
- · Charging habits.

## NISSAN recommends the following driving habits to help maximize vehicle range: Before driving:

- · Follow recommended periodic maintenance.
- · Keep tires inflated to correct pressure.
- · Keep wheels in correct alignment.
- · Pre-heat or pre-cool the interior cabin while the vehicle is charging.
- · Remove unnecessary cargo from the vehicle.

## While driving:

- · Drive in ECO mode
- -- The ECO mode helps reduce power consumption by reducing acceleration whencomparedtothesameaccelerator pedal position in the D (Drive) position (normal mode).
- · Drive at a constant speed. Maintain cruising speeds with constant accelerator positions or by using cruise control when appropriate.
- · Accelerate slowly and smoothly. Gently press and release the accelerator pedal for acceleration and deceleration.
- · Drive at moderate speeds on the highway.
- · Avoid extending highway driving with multiple quick charges.
- · Avoidfrequentstoppingandbraking.Maintain a safe distance behind other vehicles.
- · Turn off the air conditioner/heater when it is not necessary.
- · Select a moderate temperature setting for heating or cooling to help reduce power consumption.
- · Use the air conditioner/heater and close windowstoreducedragwhencruisingat highway speed.
- · Vehicle range may be substantially reduced in extremely cold conditions (for example, -4°F (-20°C)).
- · Using the climate control system to heat the cabin when the outside temperature is below 32°F (0°C) uses more electricity and affects vehicle range more than when using the heater when the temperature is above 32°F (0°C).
- · When it is cold, use the steering wheel heater in substitution for the heater/air conditioner. The steering wheel heater consumes less power than the heater/ air conditioner.
- · Release the accelerator pedal to slow down and do not apply the brakes when traffic and road conditions allow.
- -- This vehicle is equipped with a regenerative brake system. The primary purpose of the regenerative brake system is to provide some power to recharge the Li-ion battery and extend driving range. A secondary benefit is 'engine braking' that operates based on Li-ion battery conditions. In the D (Drive) position, when the accelerator is released, the regenerative brake system provides some deceleration and some power to the Li-ion battery.

## LI-ION BATTERY LIFE

The Li-ion battery's ability to hold a charge, like all batteries, decreases with battery age and usage which results in decreased vehicle range when compared to the vehicle range when the vehicle was new. This is normal and expected, and does not indicate a malfunction of the vehicle or Li-ion battery.

The Li-ion battery's ability to hold a charge can be affected by how you drive the vehicle, store the vehicle, how you charge the Li-ion battery and Li-ion battery temperature during vehicle operation and charging.

To maximize the battery's useful life, use the following driving and charging habits where possible:

- · Avoid exposing a vehicle to extreme ambient temperatures for extended periods.
- · Avoid storing a vehicle in temperatures below -13°F (-25°C) for more than seven days.
- · Avoid leaving your vehicle for more than 14 days where the Li-ion battery available chargegaugereachesazeroornearzero (state of charge).
- · Allow the vehicle and Li-ion battery to cool down after use before charging.
- · Park/store your vehicle in cool locations out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources.
- · Avoid sustained high battery temperatures (caused, for example, by exposure to very high ambient temperatures or extending highway driving with multiple quick charges.
- · Usethe normal charging or trickle charging methods to charge the Li-ion battery and minimize the use of public Fast Charge or Quick Charger.
- · Moderate driving.
- · Use of ECO mode.
- · Do not operate the charging timer repeatedly while the charge connector is connected to the vehicle after the Li-ion battery charging is completed. Doing so may discharge the 12-volt battery.

## WARNING

- · If you use any medical electric devices, such as an implantable cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardiovascular defibrillator, check with the electric medical device manufacturer concerning the effects that charging may have on implanted devices before starting the charge operation. Charging may affect the operation.
- · Make sure there is no water or foreign materials in the charge port, charge connector, or electrical plug, and that they are not damaged or affected by rust or corrosion. If any of these conditions are noticeable, do not charge the Li-ion battery. This may result in a short circuit or electric shock and could cause a fire which may result in serious personal injury or death.
- · To avoid serious personal injury or death when the Li-ion battery is charging, be aware of the following precautions.
- -Donottouchthemetalcontactsof the charge port, charge connector, electrical plug or Genuine NISSAN Adapter.

- -Donottouch the vehicle and EVSE when there is lightning.
- -Donotpull, twist, bend, step on, or drag the cable.
- · Make sure the charge connector is removedfromthechargeportbefore starting your vehicle. If the charge connector is only partially engaged and the connector latch is unlocked, it is possible to place the EV in the READY to drive position.
- · Donot touch the plug or the Genuine NISSAN Adapter if they are wet or with wet hands. Do not put the plug or the Genuine NISSAN Adapter in water, liquid or snow. This may cause an electric shock which may result in serious personal injury or death.
- · Do not disassemble or modify the charge port, the EVSE or the Genuine NISSAN Adapter. This may cause a fire or an electric shock which may result in serious personal injury or death.
- · If you notice an unusual odor, smoke or abnormal noises coming from the vehicle, stop charging immediately.
- · Be careful not to allow your hands, hair, jewelry or clothing to come into contact with, or get caught in, the traction motor cooling fan. The cooling fan can start at any time during charging.
- · Donotuseextension cords or adapters unless they are Genuine NISSAN parts.

## CAUTION

- · To prevent damage to the charging equipment:
- -Do not close the charge port lid without closing the charge port cap.
- -Do not subject the charging equipment to impact.
- -Do not store and use charging equipment in locations where the temperature is over 185°F (85°C)
- · Make sure the charge port cap is closed on the charge port when charging is finished. If the charge port lid is closed when the charge port cap is open, water or foreign materials may enter the charge port.
- · Do not charge when a vehicle body cover is in use. This may cause damage to the charge connector.
- · Do not attempt to perform a jump start on the 12-volt battery at the same time that the Li-ion battery is being charged. Doing so may damage the vehicle or charging equipment and could cause an injury. For additional information, see 'Jump starting' (P. 6-10).
- · In normalcharging(AC220-240volt) andtricklecharging(AC110-120volt) using the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) provided with the vehicle, NISSAN recommends using an AC 220 - 240 volt, 50A and an AC 110120 volt, 15A dedicated electrical circuit and outlet. The dedicated circuit is used to help prevent circuit damage or the circuit breaker from trippingduetothehighdrawofcharging the Li-ion battery. If the dedicated
- circuit is not used, the circuit may cause adverse interference on MCB (Moulded Circuit Board) and household electrical appliances such as televisions and audio systems. If the circuit is shared, and another electrical device is being used at the same time the vehicle is charging, the breaker may trip. A qualified electrician should install a dedicated circuit if one is not already available.

## NOTE:

- · WhenchargingtheLi-ionbattery,place the power switch in the OFF position. When the power switch is in the ON position, the Li-ion battery will not start charging.
- · Foryoursafety,if the charge connector is connected to the vehicle while the power switch is in the READY to drive, the vehicle will automatically switch to the ON position. Because charging will not be started while the power switch is in this position, be sure to place the power switch in the OFF position.
- · Whenthe ambient temperature is 32°F (0°C) or less, charging time may be longer than normal and the level to which the Li-ion battery can be charged may be less than at higher temperatures.

- · Do not operate the charging timer repeatedly while the charge connector is connected to the vehicle after the Li-ion battery charging is completed. Doing so may discharge the 12-volt battery. For additional information, see 'Charging timer' (P. CH-43). If the Li-ion battery becomes discharged, charge it immediately.
- · The power switch can be set to the ON position and the climate control and navigation system (if so equipped) can be used while the Li-ion battery is charging. However, because these operations consume Li-ion battery power, it will take longer for the Li-ion battery to become fully charged. Place the powerswitchintheOFFpositiontohelp reduce Li-ion battery charge time.
- · If electrical power is interrupted while charging, charging restarts automatically when the electrical power is restored.
- · It is recommended to keep the charge cable connected to save Li-ion battery power, when the heater and air conditioner are operating with remote operation (models with Navigation System).

- · If the charge port is frozen, melt the ice using a hair dryer. After the ice has melted,chargetheLi-ionbattery.Forcing the charge connector to connect maycause a malfunction.
- · If foreign materials have entered the charge connector and charge port and it is not possible to connect it, do not attempt to force the connection. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer. Forcing the charge connector to connect may cause damage to the charging equipment and vehicle.
- · There is a hole on the charge port for water drainage. If the water drainage hole becomes blocked, or if water gets trapped inside the charge port, do not charge. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer.

## TYPES OF CHARGE AND HOW TO CHARGE THE LI-ION BATTERY

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

*1: V2X (Vehicle to everything); The EV supplies electric power to a home or a building etc. (e.g. Vehicle to home (V2H), Vehicle to building (V2B), Vehicle to grid (V2G), Vehicle to load (V2L), and Vehicle to vehicle (V2V)).

This vehicle is an electric vehicle and it requires electricity to operate. The Li-ion battery is the only source of power to operate the vehicle. It is important to conserve power and plan your charging needs when you drive to avoid completely discharging the Li-ion battery and being unable to drive.

There are three methods available to charge the Li-ion battery:

- · Normal charge
- · Trickle charge
- · Quick charge
- · V2X charge/discharge

The time to completely charge the vehicle Li-ion battery varies based on the state of charge of the Li-ion battery, condition and age of the Li-ion battery, temperature of the Li-ion battery, ambient temperature and condition of the power source connected to the vehicle, and whether the electric equipment (such as the air conditioner, which consumes electric power) is used.

## Normal charge

NISSAN recommends using normal charging for usual charging of the vehicle. Use of quick charge should be minimized in order to help prolong Li-ion battery life.

Normal charging uses L1 & L2 EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment), or an SAE J1772 compliant charging device connected to a dedicated AC 220 - 240 volt circuit. L1 & L2 EVSE is provided with the vehicle (if so equipped). The charging device is a home charging dock installed in your home by a qualified electrician. Contact your NISSAN certified LEAF dealer. For additional information, see 'How to normal charge' (P. CH-10).

## Trickle charge

Trickle charging is not recommended for regular use because it takes more time than normal charging. Trickle charge can beusedwhenitisnecessarytoperforman emergency charge at a destination such as a friend's house.

Trickle charge uses the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) provided with the vehicle or an SAE J1772 compliant cord set to connect the vehicle to an AC 110-120 volt, 15A dedicated outlet. The outlet should be protected by a circuit breaker to avoid overloading the circuit or other electrical hazard.

For additional information, see 'How to trickle charge' (P. CH-11) or (P. CH-18).

## Quick charge

Quick charge capability is only available on vehicles manufactured with the quick charge option, which includes the quick charge port. If your vehicle does not have suchaport,quick charging cannot be used.

A vehicle equipped with a quick charge port is compatible with most CHAdeMO (Japanese industry standard) connectors on charging stations. Charging stations using this standard are UL certified and safe to use in the US. While supported by NISSAN, this connector may not become the US SAE standard.

Quick charging is possible (even several times a day). If the battery temperature is near the red zone, in order to protect the battery, power of the quick charging will be limited.

## Public charging:

This vehicle is compatible with any public charging station that is SAE J1772 compliant. If you attempt to charge from a noncompliant charging station, you may not receive a complete charge, or you may not be able to charge at all due to hardware andsoftware differences. NISSAN is working with states, municipalities, utility companies and others to assist in the preparation

of markets and infrastructure. However, NISSAN makes no representations that public charging stations will be available in locations where you wish to operate the vehicle, nor can NISSAN predict the period of time it may take for public charging infrastructure to be developed in your area. Depending on where you live or drive, there may not be sufficient public charging stations available to meet your particular needs for driving range and charging away from your home. Trip planning is therefore important, and you should plan trips with these facts in mind.

Quick charge uses public charging stations (up to 50 kW of power [for 40 kWh battery models] / 100 kW of power [for 60 kWh battery models]).

The time needed to charge the Li-ion battery from discharged (low battery charge indicator light illuminated) to 80% charged using the quick charger depends on many factors including the Li-ion battery temperature and the type of quick charger used.

It may take more time to charge the Li-ion battery using the quick charger if the vehicle is parked in a cold location for a long time.

It may take more time to charge the Li-ion battery using the quick charger if the temperature of the Li-ion battery is high or low.

The Li-ion battery temperature gauge can be used to estimate the approximate time neededtochargetheLi-ionbatteryto80%. If charging stops mid-charge, you can restart charging by pressing the start button on the quick charger station again. Quick charging is possible (even several times a day). If the battery temperature is near the red zone, in order to protect the battery, power of the quick charging will be limited.

For 40 kWh battery models

<!-- image -->

For 60 kWh battery models* *Subject to charging equipment capability to output 100kW

<!-- image -->

## V2X charge/discharge

V2X charge/discharge capability is only available on vehicles manufactured with the V2X charge/discharge option, which includes the quick charge port.

A vehicle equipped with a quick charge port is compatible with most CHAdeMO (Japanese industry standard) connectors on charging stations.

Charging stations or V2X charging/ discharging devices using this standard are UL certified and safe to use in the US. While supported by NISSAN, this connector may not become the US SAE standard. V2Xcharging/discharging is possible (even several times a day).If the battery temperature is near the red zone, in order to protect the battery, power of the V2X charging/ discharging will be limited.

For additional information, consult a V2X device manufacturer or a V2X charging/ discharging service provider.

## Power limitation mode

This mode protects the health and operation of the vehicle's Li-ion battery. This mode operates in certain extreme conditions (heat, cold, low state of charge). Power available to vehicle systems, including its traction motor, is limited resulting in limited performance, acceleration and top speed. Charging may be automatically terminated, especially with repeated quick charging in extreme hot weather.

## Checking Li-ion battery charge

Thethreemethodsforcheckingtheamount of charge are as follows:

- · Check by using the Li-ion battery available charge gauge on the vehicle information display when the power switch is placed in the ON position. For additional information, see 'Li-ion battery available charge gauge' (P. 2-9) and 'Low battery charge indicator' (P. 2-36).
- · Check by using an internet enabled smart phone or personal computer. For additional information, refer to the 'NissanConnect® Manual'.
- · Checkbyusingthechargingstatusindicator light. For additional information, see 'Chargingstatusindicatorlights' (P.CH-50).

## NOTE:

- · During the charge operation, charge continues when the power switch is placed in the ON position.
- · The Li-ion battery cannot be charged if the quick charge connector and the normal charge connector are connected at the same time. If another charge connector is connected midcharge, charging will stop.

- · For safety reasons, it is not possible to switch to the READY to drive position while a charge connector is connected.
- · During charging, it is possible that the radio may be inaudible due to noise by the electromagnetic wave.

## SEAT BELTS

## PRECAUTIONS ON SEAT BELT USAGE

If you are wearing your seat belt properly adjusted, and you are sitting upright and well back in your seat with both feet on the floor, your chances of being injured or killed in an accident and/or the severity of injury may be greatly reduced. NISSAN strongly encourages you and all of your passengers to buckle up every time you drive, even if your seating position includes a supplemental air bag.

Most U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories specify that seat belts be worn at all times when a vehicle is being driven.

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

- · Every person who drives or rides in this vehicle should use a seat belt at all times. Children should be in the rear seats and in an appropriate restraint.
- · The seat belt should be properly adjusted to a snug fit. Failure to do so may reduce the effectiveness of the entire restraint system and increase the chance or severity of injury in an accident. Serious injury or death can occur if the seat belt is not worn properly.
- · Always route the shoulder belt over your shoulder and across your chest. Never put the belt behind your back, under your arm or across your neck. The belt should be away from your face and neck, but not falling off your shoulder.
- · Position the lap belt as low and snug as possible AROUND THE HIPS, NOT THE WAIST. A lap belt worn too high could increase the risk of internal injuries in an accident.
- · Be sure the seat belt tongue is securely fastened to the proper buckle.
- · Do not wear the seat belt inside out or twisted. Doing so may reduce its effectiveness.
- · Do not allow more than one person to use the same seat belt.
- · Never carry more people in the vehicle than there are seat belts.
- · If the seat belt warning light glows continuously while the power switch is turnedONwithalldoorsclosedand all seat belts fastened, it may indicate a malfunction in the system. Have the system checked. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.
- · No changes should be made to the seat belt system.For example,do not modify the seat belt, add material, or install devices that may change the seat belt routing or tension. Doing so may affect the operation of the seat belt system. Modifying or tampering with the seat belt system may result in serious personal injury.
- · Once seat belt pretensioner(s) have activated, they cannot be reused and must be replaced together with the retractor.It is recommendedthatyou visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.
- · All seat belt assemblies, including retractors and attaching hardware, should be inspected after any collision. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service. NISSAN recommends that all seat belt assemblies in use during a collision be replaced unless the collision was minor and the belts show no damage and continue to operate properly.

## SEAT BELT WARNING LIGHT AND CHIME

The driver and front passenger seat is equipped with an enhanced seat belt reminder function. If your vehicle is equipped with an enhanced seat belt reminder function, a visual and audible alert will operate if a driver or front passenger seat belt is unbuckled at speeds of approximately 9 mph (15 km/h) or more under the following conditions:

- · If the driver seat belt is not fastened.
- · The front passenger's seat belt is not fastened and the seat is occupied by a passenger for 7 seconds after the power switch is placed in the ON position.
- · The front passenger's seat belt is not fastened and objects or external force on the passenger seat change the seat belt reminder classification to Occupied.

The seat belt warning light will flash under the conditions shown above until the necessary seat belt is securely fastened.

A warning chime will sound for approximately 90 seconds or until one of the following conditions is met:

- · The unbuckled front occupant's seat belt is securely fastened.
- · The seat belt reminder function in the front passenger seat no longer detects that the front passenger seat is occupied.
- · The power switch is turned off or the vehicle is placed in P (Park).

The below situations could result in the seat belt reminder light being illuminated and the chime sounding, even with no occupant present in the passenger seat:

- · Heavy objects placed on the seat.
- · Someone pushing or pulling on the front passenger seat.
- · An object placed under the front passenger seat.
- · An object placed between the seat cushion and center console or between the seat cushion and the door.
- · An object hanging on the seat or placed in the seatback pocket.
- · A child restraint or other object pressing against the rear of the seatback.

## NOTE:

## The rear seats may be equipped with a seat belt warning in the vehicle information display.

For additional information, see 'Vehicle Information display' (P. 2-26).

## PREGNANT WOMEN

NISSAN recommends that pregnant womenuseseatbelts.Theseatbeltshould be worn snug, and always position the lap belt as low as possible around the hips, not the waist. Place the shoulder belt over yourshoulderandacrossyourchest.Never put the lap/shoulder belt over your abdominal area. Contact your doctor for specific recommendations.

## INJURED PERSONS

NISSAN recommends that injured persons use seat belts, depending on the injury. Check with your doctor for specific recommendations.

## THREE-POINT TYPE SEAT BELT WITH RETRACTOR

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Every person who drives or rides in this vehicle should use a seat belt at all times.
- · Do not ride in a moving vehicle when the seatback is reclined. This can be dangerous.The shoulder belt will not be against your body. In an accident, you could be thrown into it and receive neck or other serious injuries. Youcouldalsoslideunderthelapbelt and receive serious internal injuries.
- · Donotallow children to play with the seat belts. Most seating positions are equipped with Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) mode seat belts. If the seat belt becomes wrapped around a child's neck with the ALR mode activated, the child can be seriously injured or killed if the seat belt retracts and becomes tight. This can occur even if the vehicle is parked. Unbuckle the seat belt to release the child. If the seat belt cannot be unbuckled or is already unbuckled, release the child by cutting the seat belt with a suitable tool (such as a knife or scissors) to release the seat belt.

## Fastening the seat belts

- 1. Adjust the seat. For additional information, see 'Seats' (P. 1-2).
- · For the most effective protection whenthe vehicle is in motion, the seat shouldbeupright.Alwayssit well back and upright in the seat with both feet on the floor and adjust the seat belt properly.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 2. Slowly pull the seat belt out of the retractor and insert the tongue into the buckle until you hear and feel the latch engage.
- · The retractor is designed to lock during a sudden stop or on impact. A slow pulling motion permits the belt to move and allows you some freedom of movement in the seat.
- · If the seat belt cannot be pulled from its fully retracted position, firmly pull the belt and release it. Then smoothly pull the belt out of the retractor.

- 3. Position the lap belt portion low and snug on the hips as shown.
- 4. Pull the shoulder belt portion toward the retractor to take up extra slack. Be sure the shoulder belt is routed over your shoulder and across your chest.

The front passenger seat and the rear seating positions three-point seat belts have two modes of operation:

- · Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR)
- · Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR)

The ELR mode allows the seat belt to extend and retract to allow the driver and passengers some freedom of movement in the seat. The ELR locks the seat belt when the vehicle slows down rapidly or during certain impacts.

The ALR mode (child restraint mode) locks the seat belt for child restraint installation.

When ALR mode is activated the seat belt cannot be extended again until the seat belt tongue is detached from the buckle and fully retracted. The seat belt returns to the ELR mode after the seat belt fully retracts. For additional information, see 'Child restraints' (P. 1-22).

The ALR mode should be used only for child restraint installation. During normalseatbeltusebyanoccupant,theALR mode should not be activated. If it is activated,it may cause uncomfortableseat belt tension.

## Shoulder belt height adjustment (front seats)

The shoulder belt anchor height should be adjusted to the position that is best for you. For additional information, see 'Precautions on seat belt usage' (P. 1-10).

To adjust, pull the adjustment button O 1 , andthenmovetheshoulderbeltanchorto the preferred position O 2 so that the belt passes over the center of the shoulder. The belt should be away from your face and neck, but not falling off of your shoulder. Release the adjustment button to lock the shoulder belt anchor into position.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · After adjustment, release the adjustment button and then try to move the shoulder belt anchor up and down to make sure that it is securely fixed in position.
- · The shoulder belt anchor height should be adjusted to the position that is best for you. Failure to do so may reduce the effectiveness of the entire restraint system and increase the chance or severity of injury in an accident.

## SEAT BELT EXTENDERS

If, because of body size or driving position, it is not possible to properly fit the lap/ shoulder belt and fasten it, an extender that is compatible with the installed seat belts is available for purchase. The extender adds approximately 8 in (200 mm) of length and may be used for either the driver or front passenger seating position. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for assistance with purchasing an extender if an extender is required.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Only NISSAN seat belt extenders, made by the same company which made the original equipment seat belts, should be used with NISSAN seat belts.
- · Adults and children who can use the standard seat belt should not use an extender. Such unnecessary use couldresultinseriouspersonalinjury in the event of an accident.
- · Never use seat belt extenders to install child restraints. If the child restraint is not secured properly, the child could be seriously injured or killed in a collision or a sudden stop.

## SEAT BELT MAINTENANCE

- · To clean the seat belt webbing, apply a mild soap solution or any solution recommended for cleaning upholstery or carpets. Then wipe with a cloth and allow the seat belts to dry in the shade. Do not allow the seat belts to retract until they are completely dry.
- · If dirt builds up in the shoulder belt guide of the seat belt anchors, the seat belts may retract slowly. Wipe the shoulder belt guide with a clean, dry cloth.
- · Periodically check to see that the seat belt and the metal components, such as buckles, tongues, retractors, flexible wires and anchors, work properly. If loose parts, deterioration, cuts or other damage on the webbing is found, the entire seat belt assembly should be replaced.

## CHILD SAFETY

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Do not allow children to play with the seat belts. Most seating positions are equipped with Automatic Locking Retractor(ALR)modeseatbelts.Iftheseat belt becomes wrapped around a child's neck with the ALR mode activated, the child can be seriously injured or killed if the seat belt retracts and becomes tight. This can occur even if the vehicle is parked. Unbuckle the seat belt to release the child. If the seat belt cannot be unbuckled or is already unbuckled, release the child by cutting the seat belt with a suitable tool (such as a knife or scissors) to release the seat belt.

## Children need adults to help protect them. They need to be properly restrained.

In addition to the general information in this manual, child safety information is available from many other sources, including doctors, teachers, government traffic safety offices, and community organizations. Every child is different, so be sure to learn the best way to transport your child.

There are three basic types of child restraint systems:

- · Rear-facing child restraint
- · Forward-facing child restraint
- · Booster seat

Theproper restraint depends on the child's size. Generally, infants up to about 1 year andlessthan20lbs.(9kg)shouldbeplaced in rear-facing child restraints. Forwardfacing child restraints are available for children who outgrow rear-facing child restraints and are at least 1 year old. Booster seats are used to help position a vehicle lap/shoulder belt on a child who can no longer use a forward-facing child restraint.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Infants and children need special protection. The vehicle's seat belts may not fit them properly. The shoulder belt maycometooclosetothefaceorneck. The lap belt may not fit over their small hip bones. In an accident, an improperly fitting seat belt could cause serious or fatal injury. Always use appropriate child restraints.

All U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories require the use of approved child restraints for infants and small children. For additional information, see 'Child restraints' (P. 1-22).

A child restraint may be secured in the vehicle by using either the LATCH (Lower Anchor and Tethers for CHildren) system or with the vehicle seat belt. For additional information, see 'Child restraints' (P. 1-22).

NISSAN recommends that all pre-teens andchildren be restrained in the rear seat. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.

This is especially important because your vehicle has a supplemental restraint system(air bag system) for the front passenger. For additional information, see 'Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)' (P. 1-43).

## INFANTS

Infants up to at least 1 year old should be placed in a rear-facing child restraint. NISSAN recommends that infants be placed in child restraints that comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.

Youshould choose a child restraint that fits your vehicle and always follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation and use.

## SMALL CHILDREN

Children that are over 1 year old and weigh at least 20 lbs. (9 kg) should remain in a rear-facing child restraint as long as possible up to the height or weight limit of the child restraint. Children who outgrow the height or weight limit of the rear-facing child restraint and are at least 1 year old shouldbesecuredinaforward-facingchild restraint with a harness.Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for minimum and maximum weight and height recommendations. NISSAN recommends that small children be placed in child restraints that comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. You should choose a child restraint that fits your vehicle and always follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation and use.

## LARGER CHILDREN

Children should remain in a forward-facing child restraint with a harness until they reach the maximum height or weight limit allowed by the child restraint manufacturer.

Onceachildoutgrowstheheightorweight limit of the harness-equipped forwardfacing child restraint, NISSAN recommends that the child be placed in a commercially available booster seat to obtain proper seatbelt fit. For a seat belt to fit properly, the booster seat should raise the child so that the shoulder belt is properly positioned across the chest and the top, middle portion of the shoulder. The shoulder belt should not cross the neck or face and should not fall off the shoulder. The lap belt should lie snugly across the lower hips or upper thighs, not the abdomen.

A booster seat can only be used in seating positions that have a three-point type seat belt. The booster seat should fit the vehicle seat and have a label certifying that it complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or Canadian MotorVehicle Safety Standards. Once the child has grown so the

shoulderbeltisnolongeronorneartheface and neck, the lap belt can be positioned properly across the lower hips or upper thighs, use the seat belt without the booster seat.

A booster seat should be used until the child can pass the seat belt fit test below:

- · Are the child's back and hips against the vehicle seatback?
- · Is the child able to sit without slouching?
- · Do the child's knees bend easily over the front edge of the seat with feet flat on the floor?
- · Canthechildsafelyweartheseatbelt(lap belt low and snug across the hips and shoulder belt across mid-chest and shoulder)?
- · Is the child able to use the properly adjusted head restraint/headrest?
- · Will the child be able to stay in position for the entire ride?

<!-- image -->

If you answered no to any of these questions, the child should remain in a booster seat using a three-point type seat belt.

## NOTE:

Laws in some communities may follow different guidelines. Check local and state regulations to confirm your child is using the correct restraint system before traveling.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Never let a child stand or kneel on any seat and do not allow a child in the cargo areas. The child could be seriously injured or killed in an accident or sudden stop.

## CAUTION

A child restraint in a closed vehicle can become very hot. Check the seating surface and buckles before placing a child in the child restraint.

This vehicle is equipped with a universal child restraint anchor system, referred to as the LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) system. Some child restraints include rigid or webbing-mounted attachments that can be connected to these anchors.

For additional information, see 'LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) system' (P. 1-24).

If you do not have a LATCH compatible child restraint, the vehicle seat belts can be used.

Several manufacturers offer child restraints for infants and small children of various sizes. When selecting any child restraint, keep the following points in mind:

- · Choose only a restraint with a label certifying that it complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213.
- · Checkthechildrestraint in your vehicle to be sure it is compatible with the vehicle's seat and seat belt system.
- · If the child restraint is compatible with your vehicle, place your child in the child restraint and check the various adjustments to be sure the child restraint is compatible with your child. Choose a child restraint that is designed for your child's height and weight. Always follow all recommended procedures.
- · If the combined weight of the child and child restraint is less than 65 lbs. (29.5 kg), you may use either the LATCH anchors or the seat belt to install the child restraint (not both at the same time).
- · If the combined weight of the child and child restraint is greater than 65 lbs. (29.5 kg), use the vehicle's seat belt (not the lower anchors) to install the child restraint.
- · Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer's instructions for installation.

All U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories require that infants and small children be restrained in an approved child restraint at all times while the vehicle is being operated. Canadian law requires the top tether strap on forwardfacing child restraints be secured to the designated anchor point on the vehicle.

LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) SYSTEM

Your vehicle is equipped with special anchor points that are used with LATCH system compatible child restraints. This system may also be referred to as the ISOFIX or ISOFIX compatible system. With this system, you do not have to use a vehicle seat belt to secure the child restraint unless the combined weight of the child and child restraint exceeds 65 lbs. (29.5 kg). If the combined weight of the child and child restraint is greater than 65 lbs. (29.5 kg) use

thevehicle's seat belt (not the lower anchors) to install the child restraint. Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer's instructions for installation.

The LATCH anchor points can be used to install child restraints in either of the rear outboard seating positions or in the center rear seating position. Please refer to the following section of this Owner's Manual for specific information about installing a child restraint in the center rear seating position using the LATCH anchors.

LATCH lower anchor location LATCH lower anchor location

<!-- image -->

The LATCH lower anchors are located at the rear of the seat cushion near the seatback. A label is attached to the seatback to help you locate the LATCH lower anchors.

## LATCH in the center rear seating position

There are no LATCH anchors dedicated to the center rear seating position. However, the inboard LATCH anchors belonging to the two outboard seating positions (indicated by the arrows) can be used together to secure a CRS in the center rear seating position. These anchors are separated by a distance O A of 15.8 in (400.3 mm). Before attempting to secure a CRS in this seating position, ensure that the CRS manufacturer's instructions permit the use of LATCH anchors with the spacing indicated above.

(These are sometimes referred to as 'shared anchors' or 'borrowed anchors.')

CRS with rigid lower attachments cannot be installed in the center seat. This type of CRS should only be installed in the outboard seating positions.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Never attach two CRS attachments to the same LATCH anchor. This may overload the anchor in a collision, which could increase the risk of the occupant's serious injury or death.
- · Wheninstalling the CRS in the center rear seating position with the inboard LATCH anchors, be careful to ensure any occupant or CRS in the outboard seating positions is properly restrained using the vehicle seat belt and there is no interference with the center CRS installation. If the outboard occupants cannot be properly restrained,considerusingthevehicle seat belt to restrain the CRS in the center seating position, or moving the CRS to another position instead.

## WARNING

Child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used to attach adult seat belts, or other items or equipment to the vehicle. Doing so could damage the child restraint anchorages. The child restraint will not be properly installed using the damaged anchorage, and a child could be seriously injured or killed in a collision.

## FORWARD-FACING CHILD RESTRAINT INSTALLATION USING THE SEAT BELTS

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

The three-point seat belt with Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) must be used when installing a child restraint. Failure to use the ALR mode will result in the child restraint not being properly secured. The restraint could tip over or be loose and cause injury to a child in a sudden stop or collision. Also, it can change the operation of the front passenger air bag. For additional information, see 'Front passenger air bag and status light' (P. 1-34).

Forward-facing (front passenger seat) - step 1

<!-- image -->

For additional information, see all Warnings and Cautions in 'Child safety' (P. 1-19) and 'Child restraints' (P. 1-22) before installing a child restraint.

Do not use the lower anchors if the combined weight of the child and the child restraint exceeds 65 lbs. (29.5 kg). If the combined weight of the child and the child restraint is greater than 65 lbs. (29.5 kg), use the vehicle's seat belt (not the lower anchors) to install the child restraint. Be sure to follow the child restraint manufacturer's instructions for installation.

Follow these steps to install a forwardfacing child restraint using the vehicle seat belt in the rear seat or in the front passenger seat:

- 1. If you must install a child restraint in the front seat, it should be placed in the forward-facing direction only. Move the seat to the rearmost position. Child restraints for infants must be used in the rear-facing direction and therefore must not be used in the front seat.
- 2. Position the child restraint on the seat. Always follow the child restraint manufacturer's instructions.
- The back of the child restraint should be secured against the seatback.

If necessary, adjust the head restraint/ headrest to obtain the correct child restraint fit. If the head restraint/headrest is removed, store it in a secure place. Besuretoreinstall the head restraint/ headrest when the child restraint is removed. For additional information, see 'Head restraints/headrests' (P. 1-7).

If the seating position does not have an adjustable head restraint/headrest and it is interfering with the proper child restraint fit, try another seating position or a different child restraint.

Forward-facing - step 3

Booster seats of various sizes are offered by several manufacturers. When selecting any booster seat, keep the following points in mind:

- · Choose only a booster seat with a label certifying that it complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 or CanadianMotorVehicleSafetyStandard213.
- · Check the booster seat in your vehicle to be sure it is compatible with the vehicle's seat and seat belt system.
- · Makesurethechild'sheadwillbeproperly supported by the booster seat or vehicle seat. The seatback must be at or above the center of the child's ears. For example, if a low back booster seat O 1 is chosen, the vehicle seatback must be at or above the center of the child's ears. If the seatbackislowerthanthecenterofthechild's ears, a high back booster seat O 2 should be used.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · If the booster seat is compatible with your vehicle, place your child in the booster seat and check the various adjustments to be sure the booster seat is compatible with your child. Always follow all recommended procedures.

All U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories require that infants and small children be restrained in an approved child restraint at all times while the vehicle is being operated.

The instructions in this section apply to booster seat installation in the rear seats or the front passenger seat.

- 1. If you must install a booster seat in the front seat, move the seat to the rearmost position.

## Supplemental front-impact air bag system

The NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System can help cushion the impact force to the head andchestofthedriverandfrontpassenger in certain frontal collisions.

## Front seat-mounted side-impact supplemental air bag system

This system can help cushion the impact force to the chest and pelvic area of the driver and front passenger in certain side impact collisions. The side air bags are designed to inflate on the side where the vehicle is impacted.

## Rearoutboardseat-mountedside-impact supplemental air bag system

This system can help cushion the impact force to the chest area of the rear outboard seat passengers in certain side impact collisions. The side air bags are designed to inflate on the side where the vehicle is impacted.

## Roof-mounted curtain side-impact and rollover supplemental air bag system

This system can help cushion the impact force to the head of occupants in front and rear outboard seating positions in certain side impact collisions. In a side impact, the curtain air bags are designed to inflate on the side where the vehicle is impacted. In a rollover, the curtain air bags are designed to inflate and remain inflated for a short time.

## Driver and front passenger supplemental knee air bags

This system can help cushion the impact force to the driver's and front passenger's knee in certain collisions.

The SRS is designed to supplement the crash protection provided by the driver, passenger and rear outboard seat belts andis not a substitute for them. Seat belts should always be correctly worn, and the occupant should be seated a suitable distanceawayfromthesteeringwheel,instrument panel and door finishers. For additional information, see 'Seat belts' (P. 1-10).

## The supplemental air bags operate only when the power switch is in the ON position.

## WARNING

- · The front air bags ordinarily will not inflate in the event of a side impact, rear impact,rollover or lower severity frontal collision. Always wear your seat belts to help reduce the risk or severity of injury in various kinds of accidents.

- · The front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag will not inflate if the passenger air bag status light is lit. For additional information, see 'Front passenger air bag and status light' (P. 1-55).
- · The seat belts and the front air bags are most effective when you are sitting well back and upright in the seat with both feet on the floor. The front air bags inflate with great force. Even with the NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System,if you are unrestrained,leaning forward, sitting sideways or out of position in any way, you are at greater risk of injury or death in a crash. You may also receive serious or fatal injuries from the front air bag if you are up against it when it inflates. Always sit back against the seatbackandasfarawayaspractical from the steering wheel or instrument panel. Always properly use the seat belts.
- · The driver and front passenger seat belt buckles are equipped with sensors that detect if the seat belts are fastened. The NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System monitors the severity of a collision and seat belt usage then inflates the air bags as needed. Failure to properly wear seat belts can increase the risk or severity of injury in an accident.
- · The front passenger seat is equipped with occupant classification sensor (weight sensor) that turns the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag OFF under some conditions. This sensor is only used in this seat. Failure to be properly seated and wearing the seat belt can increase the risk or severity of injury in an accident. For additional information, see 'Front passenger air bag and status light' (P. 1-55).
- · Keep hands on the outside of the steering wheel. Placing them inside thesteeringwheelrimcouldincrease the risk that they are injured if the front air bag inflates.

To ensure proper operation of the front passenger's NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System, please observe the following items.

- · Do not allow a passenger in the rear seat to push or pull on the seatback pocket (if so equipped).
- · Do not place heavy loads heavier than 9.1 lbs. (4 kg) on the seatback, head restraint/headrest or in the seatback pocket (if so equipped).
- · Make sure that there is nothing pressing against the rear of the seatback, such as a child restraint installed in the rear seat or an object stored on the floor.
- · Make sure that there is no object placedunderthefrontpassengerseat.
- · Make sure that there is no object placedbetweentheseatcushionand center console or between the seat cushion and the door.
- · If a forward-facing child restraint is installed in the front passenger seat, do not position the front passenger seat so the child restraint contacts
- the instrument panel. If the child restraint does contact the instrument panel,thesystemmaydeterminethe seat is occupied and the passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag may deploy in a collision. Also, the front passenger air bag status light may not illuminate. Foradditional information,see 'Child restraints' (P. 1-22).
- · Confirmtheoperatingconditionwith the front passenger air bag status light.
- · If you notice that the front passenger air bag status light is not operating as described in this section, get the occupant classification system checked. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.
- · Until you have confirmed with a dealer that your passenger seat occupantclassification system is working properly, position the occupants in the rear seating positions.
- · Do not position the front passenger seat so it contacts the rear seat. If the front seat does contact the rear seat, the air bag system may determine a sensor malfunction has occurred and the front passenger air bag status light may illuminate and the supplemental air bag warning light mayflash.

This vehicle is equipped with the NISSAN AdvancedAirBagSystemforthedriverand front passenger seats. This system is designed to meet certification requirements underU.S.regulations.It is also permitted in Canada. All of the information, cautions and warnings in this manual apply and must be followed.

The driver supplemental front-impact air bag is located in the center of the steering wheel. The front passenger supplemental front-impact air bag is mounted in the instrument panel above the glove box. The front air bags are designed to inflate in higher severity frontal collisions, although they may inflate if the forces in another type of collision are similar to those of a higher severity frontal impact. They may not inflate in certain frontal collisions. Vehicle damage (or lack of it) is not always an indication of proper front air bag operation.

The NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System monitors information from the crash zone sensor and the Air bag Control Unit (ACU). Inflator operation is based on the severity of a collision and seat belt usage for the driver. For the front passenger, the occupant classification sensor is also monitored. Based on information from the sensor, only one front air bag may inflate in a crash, depending on the crash severity. Additionally, the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag may be automatically turned OFF under some conditions, depending on the weight detected on the passenger seat and how the seat belt is used. If the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are OFF, the passenger air bag status light will be illuminated. For additional information, see 'Front passenger air bag and status light' (P. 1-55). One front air bag inflating does not indicate improper performance of the system.

If you have any questions about your air bag system, it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer to obtain information about the system. If you are considering modification of your vehicle due to a disability, you may also contact NISSAN.

Contact information is contained in the front of this Owner's Manual.

When a front air bag inflates, a fairly loud noise may be heard, followed by release of smoke. This smoke is not harmful and does not indicate a fire. Care should be taken not to inhale it, as it may cause irritation and choking. Those with a history of a breathing condition should get fresh air promptly.

Front air bags, along with the use of seat belts, help to cushion the impact force on the head and chest of the front occupants. They can help save lives and reduce serious injuries. However, an inflating front air bag may cause facial abrasions or other injuries. Front air bags, other than the driver's and front passenger's supplemental knee air bags, do not provide restraint to the lower body.

Even with NISSAN Advanced Air Bags, seat belts should be correctly worn and the driver and front passenger seated upright as far as practical away from the steering wheel or instrument panel. The front air bags inflate quickly in order to help protect the front occupants. Because of this, the force of the front air bag inflating can in-

crease the risk of injury if the occupant is too close to, or is against, the air bag module during inflation.

The front air bags deflate quickly after a collision.

Thefront air bags operate only when the power switch is in the ON position.

After the power switch is placed in the ON position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates. The supplemental air bag warning light will turn off after about 7 seconds if the system is operational.

Front passenger air bag and status light

<!-- image -->

## Status light

The front passenger seat is equipped with an occupant classification sensor (weight sensor) that turns the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag on or off depending on the weight applied to the front passenger seat. The status of the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag (ON or OFF) is indicated by the front passenger air bag status light which is located on the instrument panel.

After the power switch is placed in the 'ON' position, the front passenger air bag status light on the instrument panel illuminates for about 7 seconds and then turns off or remains illuminated depending on the front passenger seat occupied status. The light operates as follows:

| CONDITION       | DESCRIPTION                                                            | PASSENGER AIR BAG STATUS LIGHT ( ) RESULT   | FRONT PASSENGER AIR BAG AND FRONT PASSENGER SUPPLEMENTAL KNEE AIR BAG STATUS   |

## WARNING

The front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are designed to automatically turn OFF under some conditions. Read this section carefully to learn how it operates. Proper use of the seat, seat belt and child restraints is necessary for most effective protection.Failure to follow all instructions in this manual concerning the use of seats, seat belts and child restraints can increase the risk or severity of injury in an accident.

## Front passenger air bag

The front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are designed to automatically turn OFF when the vehicle is operated under some conditions as described below in accordance with U.S. regulations. If the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are OFF, it will not inflate in a crash. Thedriverair bag and other air bags in your vehicle are not part of this system.

The purpose of the regulation is to help reduce the risk of injury or death from an inflating air bag to certain front passenger seat occupants,such as children, by requiring the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag to be automatically turned OFF. Certain sensors are used to meet the requirements.

The occupant classification sensor in this vehicle is a weight sensor. It is designed to detect an occupant and objects on the seat by weight. For example, if a child is in the front passenger seat, the NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System is designed to turn the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag OFF in accordance with the regulations. Also, if a child restraint of the type specified in the

regulations is on the seat, its weight and the child's weight can be detected and cause the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag to turn OFF.

Front passengerseatadultoccupantswho are properly seated and using the seat belt as outlined in this manual should not cause the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag to be automatically turned OFF. For small adults it may be turned OFF, however if the occupant takes his/her weight off the seat cushion (for example, by not sitting upright, by sitting on an edge of the seat, or by otherwise being out of position), this could cause the sensors to turn the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag OFF. Always be suretobeseatedandwearingtheseatbelt properly for the most effective protection by the seat belt and supplemental air bag.

NISSAN recommends that pre-teens and children be properly restrained in a rear seat. NISSAN also recommends that appropriate child restraints and booster seats be properly installed in a rear seat. If this is not possible, the occupant classification sensor is designed to operate as described above to turn the front passen-

ger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag OFF for specified child restraints as required by regulations. Failing to properly secure child restraints and to use the ALR mode may allow the restraint to tip or move in a collision or sudden stop. This can also result in the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag inflating in a crash instead of being OFF. For additional information, see 'Child restraints' (P. 1-22).

If the front passenger seat is not occupied, the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are designed not to inflate in a crash. However, heavy objects placed on the seat could result in air bag inflation, because of the object's weight being detected by the occupant classification sensor. Other conditions could also result in air bag inflation, such as if a child is standing on the seat, or if two children are on the seat, contrary to the instructions in this manual. Always be sure that you and all vehicle occupants are seated and restrained properly.

Using the front passenger air bag status light, you can monitor when the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are automatically turned OFF.

If an adult occupant is in the seat but the front passenger air bag status light is illuminated (indicating that the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are OFF), it could be that the person is a small adult, or is not sitting on the seat properly or not using the seat belt properly.

If a child restraint must be used in the front seat, the front passenger air bag status light may or may not be illuminated, depending on the size of the child and the type of child restraint being used. If the front passenger air bag status light is not illuminated (indicating that the front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag might inflate in a crash), it could be that the child restraint or seat belt is not being used properly. Make sure that the child restraint is installed properly, the seat belt is used properly and the occupant is positioned properly. If the front passenger air bag status light is still not illuminated, reposition the occupant or child restraint in a rear seat.

If the front passenger air bag status light will not illuminate even though you believe that the child restraint, the seat belts and the occupant are properly positioned, it is recommended that you take your vehicle to a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer. A NISSAN certified LEAF dealer can check system status by using a special tool. However, until you have confirmed with a dealer that your air bag is working properly, reposition the occupant or child restraint in a rear seat.

The NISSAN Advanced Air Bag System and front passenger air bag status light will take a few seconds to register a change in thefront passengerseatstatus.Thisis normal system operation and does not indicate a malfunction.

If a malfunction occurs in the front passenger air bag system, the supplemental air bag warning light , located in the meter and gauges area of the instrument panel, will be illuminated (blinking or steadily lit). Have the system checked. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.

## Normal operation

In order for the occupant classification sensorsystemtoclassifythefrontpassenger based on weight, please follow the precautions and steps outlined below:

## Precautions

- · Make sure that there are no objects weighing over 9.1 lbs. (4 kg) hanging on theseatorplacedintheseatbackpocket.
- · Make sure that a child restraint or other object is not pressing against the rear of the seatback.
- · Make sure that the rear passenger is not pushingorpullingonthebackofthefront passenger seat.
- · Make sure that the front passenger seat or seatback is not forced back against an object on the seat or floor behind it.
- · Make sure that there is no object placed under the front passenger seat.

## Steps

- 1. Adjust the seat as outlined in the 'Seats' (P. 1-2) section of this manual. Sit upright, leaning against the seatback, and centered on the seat cushion with your feet comfortably extended to the floor.

- 2. Make sure there are no objects on your lap.
- 3. Fasten the seat belt as outlined in the 'Seat belts' (P. 1-10) section of this manual. Front passenger seat belt buckle status is monitored by the occupant classification system and is used as an input to determineoccupancystatus.So,it is highly recommendedthatthe front passenger fasten their seat belt.
- 4. Remain in this position for 30 seconds allowing the system to classify the front passenger before the vehicle is put into motion.
- 5. Ensureproperclassification by checking the front passenger air bag status light.

## NOTE:

This vehicle's occupant classification sensor system generally keeps the classification locked during driving, so it is important that you confirm that the front passenger is properly classified prior to driving. However, the occupant classification sensor may recalculate the weightoftheoccupantundersomeconditions (both while driving and when stopped), so front passenger seat occupants should continue to remain seated as outlined above.

## Troubleshooting

If you think the front passenger air bag status light is incorrect:

- 1. If the light is ON with an adult occupying the front passenger seat:
- · Occupantisasmalladult-theairbag light is functioning as intended. The front passenger air bag and front passenger supplemental knee air bag are suppressed.

However, if the occupant is not a small adult, then this may be due to the following conditions that may be interfering with the weight sensors:

- · Occupant is not sitting upright, leaning against the seatback, and centered on the seat cushion with his/her feet comfortably extended to the floor.
- · A child restraint or other object pressing against the rear of the seatback.
- · Arearpassengerpushingorpullingon the back of the front passenger seat.
- · Forcing the front seat or seatback against an object on the seat or floor behind it.
- · An object placed under the front passenger seat.
- · An object placed between the seat cushion and center console or between the seat cushion and the door.

Front and rear outboard seat-mounted side-impact supplemental air bag and roof-mounted curtain side-impact and rollover supplemental air bag systems

The side air bags are located in the outside of the seatback of the front seats and rear outboard seats. The curtain air bags are located in the side roof rails. All of the information,cautions,andwarningsinthis manual apply and must be followed. The side air bags and curtain air bags are designed to inflate in higher severity side

collisions, although they may inflate if the forces in another type of collision are similar to those of a higher severity side impact. They are designed to inflate on the side where the vehicle is impacted. They may not inflate in certain side collisions on the side where the vehicle is impacted.

The curtain air bags are also designed to inflate in certain types of rollover collisions or near rollovers. As a result, certain vehicle movements(for example, during severe offroading) may cause the curtain air bags to inflate.

Vehicle damage (or lack of it) is not always an indication of proper side air bag and curtain air bag operation.

Whenthesideairbagsandcurtainairbags inflate, a fairly loud noise may be heard, followed by release of smoke.This smoke is not harmful and does not indicate a fire. Care should be taken not to inhale it, as it may cause irritation and choking. Those with a history of a breathing condition should get fresh air promptly.

Side air bags, along with the use of seat belts, help to cushion the impact force on the chest and pelvic area of the front and rear outboard occupants. Curtain air bags help to cushion the impact force to the

head of occupants in the front and rear outboard seating positions. They can help save lives and reduce serious injuries. However, side air bags and curtain air bags may cause abrasions or other injuries. Side air bags and curtain air bags do not provide restraint to the lower body.

The seat belts should be correctly worn and the driver, front passenger and rear outboard occupants seated upright as far as practical away from the side air bags. Rear seat passengers should be seated as far away as practical from the door finishers and side roof rails. The side air bags and curtain air bags inflate quickly in order to helpprotecttheoccupantsintheoutboard seating positions. Because of this, the force of the side air bags and curtain air bags inflating can increase the risk of injury if the occupantistoocloseto,oris against,these air bag modules during inflation. The side air bags and curtain air bags will deflate quickly after the collision is over.

The side air bags and curtain air bags operate only when the power switch is in the ON position.

After turning the power switch to the ON position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates. The supplemental air bag warning light will turn off after about 7 seconds if the systems are operational.

## WARNING

- · Donotplaceanyobjectsneartheseatback of the front and rear seats. Also, do not place any objects (an umbrella, bag, etc.) between the front and rear door finishers and the front and rear seats. Such objects may become dangerous projectiles and cause injury if a side air bag inflates.
- · Right after inflation, several side air bag and curtain air bag system components will be hot. Do not touch them; you may severely burn yourself.
- · No unauthorized changes should be made to any components or wiring of the side air bag and curtain air bag systems. This is to prevent damage to or accidental inflation of the side air bag and curtain air bag systems.

- · Do not make unauthorized changes to your vehicle's electrical system, suspension system or side panel. This could affect proper operation of the side air bag and curtain air bag systems.
- · Tampering with the side air bag system may result in serious personal injury. For example, do not change the front and rear seats by placing material near the seatbacks or by installing additional trim material, such as seat covers, around the side air bag.
- · It is recommended that you visit a NISSANcertifiedLEAFdealerforwork around and on the side air bag and curtain air bag systems. It is also recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for installation of electrical equipment. The SupplementalRestraintSystem(SRS)wiring harnesses*shouldnotbemodifiedor disconnected. Unauthorized electrical test equipment and probing devices should not be used on the side air bag and curtain supplemental air bag systems.

## Driver and front passenger supplemental knee air bag

The knee air bag is located in the knee bolster, on the driver's and passenger's side. All of the information, cautions and warnings in this manual apply and must be followed. The knee air bag is designed to inflate in higher severity frontal collisions, although it may inflate if the forces in anothertypeofcollision are similar to those of a higher severity frontal impact. It may not inflate in certain collisions.

Passenger's side

<!-- image -->

Vehicle damage(orlackofit) is not always an indication of proper knee air bag operation.

When the knee air bag inflates, a fairly loud noise may be heard, followed by release of smoke. This smoke is not harmful and does not indicate a fire. Care should be taken not to inhale it, as it may cause irritation and choking. Those with a history of a breathing condition should get fresh air promptly.

The knee air bag helps to cushion the impact force on the knees of the driver and passenger. It can help reduce serious injuries. However, an inflating knee air bag may cause abrasions or other injuries. The knee air bag provides restraint to the lower body.

The knee air bag inflates quickly in order to help protect the occupants. Because of this, the force of the knee air bag inflating can increase the risk of injury if the occupantistoocloseto,orisagainst,thisairbag module during inflation. The knee air bag will deflate quickly after the collision is over OR the knee air bag will remain inflated for a short time.

## The knee air bag operates only when the power switch is placed in the ON position.

After placing the power switch in the ON position, the supplemental air bag warning light illuminates. The supplemental air bag warning light will turn off after about 7 seconds if the system is operational.

The temperature of the Li-ion battery is within the normal range when the display is within the zone O 1 shown in the illustration.

The temperature of the Li-ion battery varies according to the outside air temperature and driving conditions.

## NOTE:

- · If the display indicates that the temperature of the Li-ion battery is near the red zone end of the normal range, reduce vehicle speed to decrease the temperature.If the indicator is over the normal range, the power provided to thetraction motor is reduced when the power limitation indicator light is illuminated. Therefore, the vehicle is not as responsive when the accelerator is depressed while the power limitation light is illuminated. For additional information, see 'Power limitation indicator light' (P. 2-23).
- · If the outside temperature is extremely low, the Li-ion temperature gauge may not display a temperature reading.The vehicle may not be able to be put in the READYto drive mode. Have the system checked. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.

## POWER METER

This meter displays the actual traction motor power consumption O A and the regenerative brake power provided to the Li-ion battery O B .

The power meter is in a neutral state

<!-- image -->

The white illuminated portion O 1 in the display moves right or left depending on demand.

The white illuminated portion O 1 moves to the right when power is provided to the traction motor (Li-ion battery discharges).

The white illuminated portion O 1 moves to the left when power is generated and provided to the Li-ion battery by the regenerative brake system (Li-ion battery charging).

The power meter also indicates if the power provided to the motor is limited or if regenerative braking is limited. When power or regenerative braking is limited, the illuminated segments on the display are narrowed O 2 .

Regenerative braking is automatically reduced when the Li-ion battery is fully charged to prevent the Li-ion battery from becoming overcharged. Regenerative braking is also automatically reduced when the Li-ion battery temperature is high/low (indicated by the red/blue zones on the Li-ion battery temperature gauge) to prevent Liion battery damage.

The more regenerative braking is reduced, the more illuminated segments on the display are narrowed O 2 .

If the Li-ion battery charge is low, power provided to the traction motor is reduced. Motor output is also limited if the Li-ion battery temperature is high/low (indicated by the red/blue zones on the Li-ion battery temperature gauge) or the Li-ion battery charge level is low.

The more power provided to the traction motor is reduced, the more illuminated segments on the display are narrowed O 2 .

## NOTE:

If the power meter is selected on the trip computer, the meter is not displayed.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## DRIVING RANGE

The driving range O 1 provides an estimated distance that the vehicle can be driven before recharging is necessary. The driving range is constantly being calculated, based on the amount of available Li-ion battery charge and the actual power consumption average.

When the power switch is placed in the OFF position, it remains for approximately 30 seconds.

## LI-ION BATTERY AVAILABLE CHARGE GAUGE

- · 1 This gauge indicates the approximate available Li-ion battery charge to run the vehicle.
- · 2 This figure shows the current state of charge (%) of the vehicle.
- · 3 Low battery charge indicator : This indicator illuminates yellow when the available Li-ion battery charge is getting low.

## NOTE:

- · The driving range display will flash when the low battery charge indicator illuminates. Additionally, if you continue to drive the vehicle in this state and the Li-ion battery is close to being completely discharged, '---' will be displayed. Charge the Li-ion battery as soon as possible. When the Li-ion battery is charged, the original display will be restored.
- · After the vehicle is charged, the displayed driving range is calculated based on the actual average energy consumption of the previous driving. The displayeddriving range will vary every time the vehicle is fully charged.
- · The driving range increases or decreases when the air conditioner, heater or Li-ion battery warmer (if so equipped) is turned on or off, or when the ECO mode is selected, or when any other accessory is turned on or off based on driving (for models with 40kWh battery).
- · If the rear seat belt reminder message is displayed, the driving range display is temporarily unavailable.

## ChargetheLi-ionbatterybeforetheblue bar of the gauge O 1 disappears.

The low battery charge indicator O 3 illuminates yellow when the available Li-ion battery charge is getting low. Charge as soon as it is convenient, preferably before the blue bar of the gauge O 1 disappears. When the blue bar of the gauge O 1 disappears and the charge indicator O 3 illuminates, there is a very small reserve of Li-ion battery charge remaining.

## NOTE:

- · Thelength of the blue bar of the gauge O 1 is determined by the available charge and the amount of charge the Li-ion battery is capable of storing at the current temperature.
- · Temperature affects the amount of charge the Li-ion battery is capable of storing.The Li-ion battery is capable of storing less power when the Li-ion battery temperature is cold. The Li-ion battery is capable of storing more power when the Li-ion battery temperature is warm. The length of the blue bar of the gauge O 1 can change based on the amount of power the

Li-ion battery is capable of storing. For example, when the Li-ion battery becomes colder, a longer blue bar of the gauge O 1 illuminates because the available charge is a greater percentage of the Li-ion battery's capability of storing power. When the Li-ion battery becomeswarmer,a shorter blue bar of the gauge O 1 illuminates because the remaining energy is a lower percentage of the Li-ion battery's capability of storing power.

## Estimated Charge Time

The Estimated Charge Time mode shows the estimated time charge the Li-ion battery to a full level. Immediately after the power switch is placed in the ON position, longer charging time may be displayed than the actual time required.

Not charging

<!-- image -->

## Howto read the display:

The displayed charging time is calculated based on the electrical (supplied to the charger), which is selected in the [Charge Time Screen] setting under the EV Settings menu. The display shows:

- O 1 The currently remaining Li-ion battery charge level.

O 2 The estimated charging time to reach each percentage (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of the Li-ion battery level.

While charging (quick charge)

<!-- image -->

- · If the estimated charging time is longer than 24 hours, [Over 24hr] is displayed.
- · When the currently remaining Li-ion battery level exceeds each percentage level, the charging time will be displayed as [---].
- · When the Li-ion battery was fully charge, all the charging time information will be displayed as [---].

O 3 The currently selected electrical power (supplied to the charger).

O 4 The estimated charge level of the Li-ion battery to be reached when the remaining charging time has passed.

O 5 Theelectrical power that is actually supplied while quick charging.

O 6 The remaining charging time before the quick charger is shut off.

When charging is not performed, pushing the OK button on the steering wheel will switch the display to the [Charge Time Screen]. Select the electrical power that you wish to show in the Estimated Charge Time display.

## NOTE:

- · While charging, the estimated charging time is calculated based on the electrical power that is currently being supplied to the charger.
- · The electrical power for the normal charging is displayed at a fixed value. Therefore,the displayed electrical power may differ from the one that is actually supplied.
- · For the quick charging, the electrical powerdisplaywill change to the actual electrical power while charging. If the charging is stopped or the power supply is stopped (unplugged, etc.), the displayed electrical power returns to the selected electrical power.
- · The displayed charging time on each percentage level is the current estimation, and the actual charging time will vary depending on the conditions of the vehicle or the state of charge.
- · Right after starting or stopping charge, the estimated charging time may differ from the actual charging time. The actual charging time will be displayed after a period of time.

## SECURITY SYSTEMS

<!-- image -->

Your vehicle has two types of security systems, as follows:

- · Vehicle security system
- · NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System

The security status is shown by the security indicator light.

## VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM

Thevehicle security system provides visual and audio alarm signals if someone opens the doors or rear hatch when the system is armed. It is not, however, a motion detection type system that activates when a vehicle is moved or when a vibration occurs.

The system helps deter vehicle theft but cannot prevent it, nor can it prevent the theft of interior or exterior vehicle components in all situations. Always secure your vehicle even if parking for a brief period. Never leave your keys in the vehicle, and always lock it when it is left unattended. Be aware of your surroundings, and park in secure, well-lit areas whenever possible.

Many devices offering additional protection, such as component locks, identification markers, and tracking systems, are available at auto supply stores and specialty shops. A NISSAN certified LEAF dealer mayalsooffersuchequipment.Checkwith your insurance company to see if you may be eligible for discounts for various theft protection features.

## How to arm the vehicle security system

- 1. Close all windows.

## The system can be armed even if the windows are open.

- 2. Place the power switch in the LOCK or OFF position and remove the Intelligent Key from the vehicle.
- 3. Close all doors. Lock all doors. The doors can be locked with:
- · the LOCK button on the Intelligent Key
- · any request switch
- · the power door lock switch
- 4. Confirm that the security indicator light illuminates. The security indicator light stays on for about 30 seconds. The vehicle security system is now pre-armed. After about 30 seconds the vehicle security system automatically shifts into the armed phase. The security light begins to flash once every approximately 3 seconds. If, during this 30-second prearmtimeperiod,the door is unlocked, or the power switch is placed in the ACC or ONposition, the system will not arm.

Evenwhenthedriverand/orpassengers are in the vehicle, the system will activate with all doors locked and the power switch in the OFF position. When placing the power switch to the ACC or ON position, the system will be released.

## Vehicle security system activation

The vehicle security system will give the following alarm:

- · Theheadlightsblink and the horn sounds intermittently.
- · The alarm automatically turns off after approximately 50 seconds. However, the alarm reactivates if the vehicle is tampered with again.

The alarm is activated by:

- · Unlocking the door without using the Intelligent Key or the request switch. (Even if the door is opened by releasing the door inside lock knob, the alarm will activate.)
- · Opening the hood.

## How to stop an activated alarm

The alarm will stop when a door is unlocked by pushing the UNLOCK button on the Intelligent Key, door handle request switch, or when the power switch is pushed in the ACC or ON position.

## NISSAN INTELLIGENT KEY®

Your vehicle can only be driven with the Intelligent Keys which are registered to your vehicle's Intelligent Key system components and NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System components.

As many as four Intelligent Keys can be registered and used with one vehicle. The new keys must be registered by a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer prior to use with the Intelligent Key system and NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System of your vehicle. Since theregistration process requires erasing all memoryinthe Intelligent Key components when registering new keys, be sure to take all Intelligent Keys that you have to the NISSAN certified LEAF dealer.

A key number plate is supplied with your keys. Record the key number and keep it in a safe place (such as your wallet), not in the vehicle. If you lose your keys, it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for duplicates by using the key number. NISSAN does not record key numbers so it is very important to keep track of your key number plate.

A key number is only necessary when you have lost all keys and do not have one to duplicate from. If you still have a key, it can be duplicated without knowing the key number.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

Besure to carry the Intelligent Key with you when driving. The Intelligent Key is a precision device with a built-in transmitter.To avoid damagingit,please not the following:

- · The Intelligent Key is water resistant; however, wetting may damage the Intelligent Key. If the Intelligent Key gets wet, immediately wipe until it is completely dry.
- · Do not bend, drop or strike it against another object.
- · If the outside temperature is below 14°F (-10°C) degrees, the battery of the Intelligent Key may not function properly.
- · DonotplacetheIntelligentKeyforan extended period in an area where temperatures exceed 140°F (60°C).
- · Do not change or modify the Intelligent Key.
- · Do not use a magnet key holder.
- · Do not place the Intelligent Key near anelectric appliance such as a television set, personal computer or cellular phone.
- · Do not allow the Intelligent Key to come into contact with water or salt water, and do not wash it in a washing machine. This could affect the system function.

If an Intelligent Key is lost or stolen, NISSAN recommends erasing the ID code of that Intelligent Key. This will prevent the Intelligent Key from unauthorized use to unlock the vehicle. For information regarding the erasing procedure, it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer.

<!-- image -->

## Mechanical key

The Intelligent Key contains the mechanical key.

To remove the mechanical key, release the lock knob on the back of the Intelligent Key.

To install the mechanical key, firmly insert it into the Intelligent Key until the lock knob returns to the lock position.

## Never leave these keys in the vehicle.

Additional or replacement keys:

If you still have a key, the key number is not necessary when you need extra NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System keys. A NISSAN certified LEAF dealer can duplicate your existing key. As many as four NISSAN Vehicle

Immobilizer System keys can be used with one vehicle. You should bring all NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System keys that you have to the NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for registration. This is because the registration process will erase the memory of all key codes previously registered into the NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System. After the registration process, these components will only recognize keys coded into the NISSAN Vehicle Immobilizer System during registration. Any virtual key accessories (if so equipped) will also have to be reregistered.Any key that is not given to the dealer at the time of registration will no longer be able to start your vehicle.

## OPERATING TIPS

- · The automatic climate control is equipped with sensors as illustrated. The sensors O A and O B help maintain a constant temperature. Do not put anything on or around these sensors.
- · Power consumption of the climate control system varies depending on the outside temperature and the temperature set for the climate control system. Power consumption increases if the interior temperature is cooled down too much in summer or if it warmed up too much in winter. This will result in a reduced driving range.

<!-- image -->

- · Using the AUTO mode will help reduce the power consumption of the climate control.
- · When the AUTO button is pressed, the AUTO indicator illuminates. The HEAT button indicator or the A/C button indicator illuminates according to the operation of the climate control system.
- · If any of the MODE, A/C, HEAT, fan speed control, front defroster is pressed when the AUTO indicator illuminates, the AUTO indicator will be turned off.
- · If the charge connector is connected to the vehicle when it is in the READY to drive mode and the air conditioner or heater is on, the power switch automatically changes to the ON position. Place the power switch in the off position to begin charging. Turn on the desired climate control function.
- · For normal charge, the climate control system is operative when charging operation is complete. For quick charge however, the climate control system stops operating when charging operation stops.
- · The climate control timer or remote climate control (for models with Navigation System) may fog up windows depending on the set temperature or outside temperature.
- · When turning on the seat heater (if so equipped) switch prior to operating the climate control timer or the remote climate control (for models with Navigation System), the seat heater will also turn on automatically when the outside temperature is low.

## IN-CABIN MICROFILTER

The climate control system is equipped with an in-cabin microfilter which collects dirt, dust etc. To make sure the air conditioner heats defogs, and ventilates efficiently, replace the filter regularly. To replace the filter, it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer.

The filter should be replaced if the air flow decreases significantly or if windows fog upeasily when operating the climate control system.

- · Timer setting can also be changed while Climate Ctrl. Timer is operated. When the power position is switched to OFF, the air conditioner starts or enters waiting mode depending on the new timer settings.
- · When the difference in temperature between the air conditioner setting temperature and the temperature outside the vehicle is large, the temperature inside the vehicle may not be maintained at the setting temperature.
- · The charging status indicator lights illuminate in a specific pattern when the Li-ion battery warmer operates. The charging status indicator lights use the same pattern to indicate 12-volt battery charging, Climate Ctrl. Timer operation or Remote Climate Control operation. The charging status indicator lights do not change if the Li-ion battery warmer operates at the same time as the above features.
- · The temperature in the passenger compartment may not be comfortable if entering the vehicle too soon before or too long after the scheduled time of departure.
- · Air conditioning is limited to the capacity of the electric power when the charge connector is connected. Therefore, the temperature may not reach the set temperature due to limitations in air conditioning performance, if ambient temperature is excessively high or low, or if the charge connector is connected to a 120-volt plug outlet.
- · The Climate Ctrl. Timer operates the climate control function so that a comfortable temperature is provided in the passenger compartment at the scheduled time of departure. The climate control is set to stop at the scheduled time of departure.
- · Depending on the facilities of charging station, there may be time when it is not available for charging. Confirm the availability of the charging facility before setting the Climate Ctrl. Timer. Be sure that the power switch of the charger is turned on when setting the Climate Ctrl. Timer.
- · WhenthepowerswitchisturnedOFFafter changing the setting, the new setting will be applied.

## Remote climate control

This vehicle incorporates a communication device that is called a TCU (Telematics Control Unit). The communication connection between this unit and Nissan Data Center allows for various remote function services.

Even when away from the vehicle, climate control can be started by accessing the WebOwnerPortalusingacellular phone or a personal computer.

When operation is started, or at the set start time, the Nissan Data Center accesses the vehicle. When the vehicle receives a command for remote operation, the climate control immediately turns ON and operates for the specified period of time.

## PRECAUTIONS WHEN STARTING AND DRIVING

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Do not leave children or adults who would normally require the support of others alone in your vehicle. Pets should not be left alone either. They could accidentally injure themselves orothersthroughinadvertentoperation of the vehicle. Also, on hot, sunny days, temperatures in a closed vehicle could quickly become high enough to cause severe or possibly fatal injuries to people or animals.
- · Properly secure all cargo with ropes or straps to help prevent it from sliding or shifting. Do not place cargo higher than the seatbacks. In a sudden stop or collision, unsecured cargo could cause personal injury.

## TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (TPMS)

Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you

should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly underinflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly underinflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces power efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.

Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate whenthe system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one

minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system maynot be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.

## Additional information

- · When using a wheel without the TPMS such as the spare tire, the TPMS does not monitorthetire pressure of the spare tire.
- · The TPMS will activate only when the vehicle is driven at speeds above 16 mph (25 km/h). Also, this system may not detect a sudden drop in tire pressure (for example, a flat tire while driving).
- · The low tire pressure warning light does not automatically turn off when the tire pressure is adjusted. After the tire is inflated to the recommended pressure, the vehicle must be driven at speeds above 16 mph (25 km/h) to activate the TPMS andturn off the low tire pressure warning light. Use a tire pressure gauge to check the tire pressure.
- · The 'Tire Pressure Low - Add Air' warning also appears on the vehicle information display when the low tire pressure warning light is illuminated and low tire pressure is detected. The 'Tire Pressure Low-AddAir' warning turns off when the low tire pressure warning light turns off.
- · The 'Tire Pressure Low - Add Air' warning appears each time the power switch is placed in the ON position as long as the low tire pressure warning light remains illuminated.
- · The 'Tire Pressure Low - Add Air' warning does not appear if the low tire pressure warning light illuminates to indicate a TPMS malfunction.
- · Tire pressure rises and falls depending on the heat caused by operation of the vehicle and the outside temperature. Do not reduce the tire pressure after driving because the tire pressure rises after driving. Low outside temperature can lower the temperature of the air inside the tire, which can cause a lower tire inflation pressure. This may cause the low tire pressure warning light to illuminate. If the warning light illuminates in low ambient temperature, check the tire pressure for all four tires.
- · The pressure of all tires can also be checked on the display screen. The order of the tire pressure figures displayed on the screen does not correspond with the actual order of the tire position.

For additional information, see 'Low tire pressure warning light' (P. 2-21) and 'Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)' (P. 6-3).

## WARNING

- · Radio waves could adversely affect electric medical equipment. Those who use a pacemaker should contact theelectric medical equipment manufacturer for the possible influences before use.
- · If the low tire pressure warning light illuminates while driving, avoid sudden steering maneuvers or abrupt braking, reduce vehicle speed, pull off the road to a safe location and stop the vehicle as soon as possible. Driving with under-inflated tires may permanently damage the tires and increase the likelihood of tire failure. Serious vehicle damage could occur and may lead to an accident and could result in serious personal injury. Check the tire pressure for all four tires. Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended COLD tire pressure shown on the Tire and Loading Information label to turn the low tire pressurewarninglightoff.Ifthetireis flat, repair it as soon as possible. For additional information, see 'Flat tire' (P. 6-3).

- · When using a wheel without the TPMSsuchasthesparetire,theTPMS will not function and the low tire pressure warning light will flash for approximately1minute.Thelightwill remain on after 1 minute. Have your tires replaced and/or TPMS system reset as soon as possible. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.
- · Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS.
- · Donotinject any tire liquid or aerosol tire sealant into the tires, as this may cause a malfunction of the tire pressure sensors.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

- · The TPMS may not function properly when the wheels are equipped with tire chains or the wheels are buried in snow.

- · Do not place metalized film or any metal parts (antenna, etc.) on the windows. This may cause poor reception of the signals from the tire pressure sensors, and the TPMS will not function properly.

Some devices and transmitters may temporarily interfere with the operation of the TPMS and cause the low tire pressure warninglight to illuminate. Some examples are:

- · Facilities or electric devices using similar radio frequencies that are near the vehicle.
- · If a transmitter set to similar frequencies is being used in or near the vehicle.
- · If a computer (or similar equipment) or a DC/AC converter is being used in or near the vehicle.

The low tire pressure warning light may illuminate in the following cases:

- · If the vehicle is equipped with a wheel and tire without TPMS.
- · If the TPMS has been replaced and the ID has not been registered.
- · If the wheel is not originally specified by NISSAN.

- 4. Perform the above steps for each tire.
- · If the tire is over-inflated more than approximately 4 psi (30 kPa), the horn beeps and the hazard indicators flash three times. To correct the pressure,
- push the core of the valve stem on the tire briefly to release pressure. When the pressure reaches the designated pressure, the horn beeps once.
- · If the hazard indicator does not flash within approximately 15 seconds after starting to inflate the tire, it indicates that the Easy-Fill Tire Alert is not operating.
- · The TPMS will not activate the Easy-Fill Tire Alert under the following conditions: - If there is interference from an external device or transmitter.
- - The air pressure from the inflation device is not sufficient to inflate the tire, such as those using a power socket.
- - If electrical equipment is being used in or near the vehicle.
- - There is a malfunction in the TPMS.
- - There is a malfunction in the horn or hazard indicators.
- - If the Easy-Fill Tire Alert does not operate due to TPMS interference, move the vehicle about 3 ft (1 m) backward or forward and try again.

If the Easy-Fill Tire Alert is not working, use a tire pressure gauge.

## AVOIDING COLLISION AND ROLLOVER

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

## Failure to operate this vehicle in a safe and prudent manner may result in loss of control or an accident.

Be alert and drive defensively at all times. Obey all traffic regulations. Avoid excessive speed, high speed cornering, or sudden steering maneuvers because these driving practices could cause you to lose control of your vehicle.

## As with any vehicle, loss of control could result in a collision with other vehicles or objects or cause the vehicle to roll over, particularly if the loss of control causes the vehicle to slide sideways.

Be attentive at all times, and avoid driving when tired. Never drive when under the influence of alcohol or drugs (including prescription or over-the-counter drugs which may cause drowsiness). Always wear your seat belt as outlined in 'Seat belts' (P. 7-7), andalso instruct your passengers to do so.

Seat belts help reduce the risk of injury in collisions and rollovers.

## In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.

## OFF-ROAD RECOVERY

While driving, the right side or left side wheels may unintentionally leave the road surface. If this occurs, maintain control of the vehicle by following the procedure below. Please note that this procedure is only ageneral guide.The vehicle must be driven as appropriate based on the conditions of the vehicle, road and traffic.

- 1. Remain calm and do not overreact.
- 2. Do not apply the brakes.
- 3. Maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands and try to hold a straight course.
- 4. Whenappropriate,slowlyreleasetheaccelerator pedal to gradually slow the vehicle.
- 5. If there is nothing in the way, steer the vehicle to follow the road while the vehicle speed is reduced. Do not attempt to drive the vehicle back onto the road surface until the vehicle speed is reduced.

- 6. When it is safe to do so, gradually turn the steering wheel until both tires return to the road surface. When all tires are on the road surface, steer the vehicle to stay in the appropriate driving lane.
- · If you decide that it is not safe to return the vehicle to the road surface based on vehicle, road or traffic conditions, gradually slow the vehicle to a stop in a safe place off the road.

## RAPID AIR PRESSURE LOSS

Rapid air pressure loss or a 'blow-out' can occur if the tire is punctured or is damaged due to hitting a curb or pothole. Rapid air pressure loss can also be caused by driving on under-inflated tires.

Rapid air pressure loss can affect the handling and stability of the vehicle, especially at highway speeds.

Help prevent rapid air pressure loss by maintaining the correct air pressure and visually inspecting the tires for wear and damage. For additional information, see 'Wheels and tires' (P. 8-25).

If a tire rapidly loses air pressure or 'blowsout' while driving, maintain control of the vehicle by following the procedure below. Please note that this procedure is only a

general guide. The vehicle must be driven as appropriate based on the conditions of the vehicle, road and traffic.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

The following actions can increase the chanceoflosingcontrolofthevehicleif there is a sudden loss of tire air pressure. Losing control of the vehicle may cause a collision and result in personal injury.

- · The vehicle generally moves or pulls in the direction of the flat tire.
- · Do not rapidly apply the brakes.
- · Donotrapidlyreleasetheaccelerator pedal.
- · Do not rapidly turn the steering wheel.
- 1. Remain calm and do not overreact.
- 2. Maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands and try to hold a straight course.
- 3. When appropriate, slowly release the accelerator pedal to gradually slow the vehicle.
- 4. Gradually steer the vehicle to a safe location off the road and away from traffic if possible.
- 5. Lightly apply the brake pedal to gradually stop the vehicle.
- 6. Turn on the hazard warning flashers and contact a roadside emergency service to change the tire. For additional information, see 'Flat tire' (P. 6-3).

## DRINKING ALCOHOL/DRUGS AND DRIVING

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

Neverdriveundertheinfluenceofalcohol or drugs. Alcohol in the bloodstream reduces coordination, delays reaction time and impairs judgement. Driving after drinking alcohol increases the likelihood of being involved in an accident injuring yourself and others. Additionally, if you are injured in an accident, alcohol can increase the severity of the injury.

NISSAN is committed to safe driving. However, you must choose not to drive under the influence of alcohol. Every year thousands of people are injured or killed in alcohol-related accidents. Although the local laws vary on what is considered to belegally intoxicated, the fact is that alcohol affects all people differently and most peopleunderestimatetheeffectsofalcohol.

Remember, drinking and driving don't mix! That is true for drugs, too (over-thecounter, prescription, and illegal drugs). Do not drive if your ability to operate your vehicle is impaired by alcohol, drugs, or some other physical condition.

## PUSH-BUTTON POWER SWITCH

## WARNING

Neverrelysolelyonthee-Pedalsystem, as there is a performance limit to the system function. Always drive carefully and attentively. The brake pedal should be operated to slow or stop the vehicle, depending on traffic or road conditions.

The e-Pedal system enables the driver to slow or stop the vehicle or to keep the vehicle stopped by operating only the accelerator pedal. This system helps to keep the driver from moving his/her foot between the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal.

E-PEDAL SYSTEM OPERATION

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 1. Acceleration
- 2. Deceleration (instead of brake pedal)
- 3. Making a stop (instead of brake pedal

When the e-Pedal system is activated, the regenerative brake is enhanced and the driver can adjust the vehicle speed by only depressing or returning the accelerator pedal. When you release (take your foot off) the accelerator pedal, the vehicle slows down and comes to a stop smoothly without depressing the brake pedal. After a stop, the vehicle remains at a stop automatically.

To activate or deactivate the e-Pedal system, place the power switch in the ON position and pull the e-Pedal switch located on the center console. The e-Pedal system turns on or off each time the e-Pedal switch is pulled. (The e-Pedal indicator in the vehicle information display shows the status of the e-Pedal system.)

To turn the e-Pedal system off while the vehicle is stopped by the e-Pedal system, depress the brake pedal and then pull the e-Pedal switch.

## NOTE:

- · When the e-Pedal system is switched on or off, the degree of vehicle deceleration changes.
- · The e-Pedal system automatically turns off when the EV system restarts.
- · To keep the e-Pedal system activated even after the EV system restarts, turn on 'Retain Mode' in the 'Driver Assistance' menuofthevehicleinformation display.For additional information,see 'Vehicle information display' (P. 2-26).
- · The setting for 'Retain Mode' does not reset after selecting 'Factory Reset' in the 'Settings' menu of the vehicle information display. For additional information, see 'Vehicle information display' (P. 2-26).

When the e-Pedal system is activated, the characteristics of the accelerator pedal change significantly and the accelerator pedal operates differently than a conventional accelerator pedal operates. Be sure to confirm the status of the e-Pedal system in the vehicle information display before driving.

The e-Pedal system provides the following driving features:

## When driving and stopping the vehicle:

- · Depressing or returning the accelerator pedal changes the degree of acceleration and deceleration accordingly.
- · Returning the accelerator pedal generatesmoredecelerationthannormal.(The maximumdeceleration changes according to the vehicle speed.)
- · Releasing (taking your foot off) the accelerator pedal reduces the vehicle speed until the vehicle comes to a stop.
- · Thevehicle's brake lights illuminate when the deceleration level reaches an ordinary braking operation.

If the deceleration is not sufficient when the accelerator pedal is returned or released, depress the brake pedal. The brake pedal can be operated to reduce the vehicle speed in the same way as normal even when the e-Pedal system is activated.

## When restarting the vehicle:

- · After the vehicle comes to a stop by the e-Pedal system function, the vehicle remainsatastopaslongastheaccelerator pedal is released.
- · The vehicle's brake lights remain illuminated when the vehicle is stopped by the e-Pedal system.
- · Depress the accelerator pedal to start the vehicle again from a stop.

Whenthevehicleneedstobestoppedfora certain period of time, place the vehicle in the P (Park) position and apply the parking brake.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

When the e-Pedal system is turned off, remember to depress the brake pedal firmly to prevent the vehicle from moving with the shift lever in any position other than P (Park).

## When backing up the vehicle:

- · With the shift lever in the R (Reverse) position, operating the accelerator pedal adjusts the vehicle speed (acceleration, deceleration, or stopping) in the same way as the D (Drive) position.

## Other driving tips for the e-Pedal system:

- · For smooth deceleration when the e-Pedal system is activated, it is recommended that you adjust the accelerator pedal by either depressing or returning, not releasing, the pedal.
- · Moving the shift lever from D (Drive) to B mode or from B mode to D (Drive) does not affect the e-Pedal system feature.
- · The e-Pedal system does not function under the following conditions:
- - When the vehicle is placed in the P (Park) or N (Neutral) position
- - When cruise control (if so equipped), ProPILOT Assist (if so equipped), or Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection operates

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use of the I-BSI system could result in serious injury or death.

- · The I-BSI system is not a replacement for proper driving procedure and is not designed to prevent contact with vehicles or objects. When changing lanes, always use the side and rear mirrors and turn and look in the direction you will move to ensure it is safe to change lanes. Never rely solely on the I-BSI system.
- · There is a limitation to the detection capability of the radar or the sonar. Not every moving object or vehicle will be detected. Using the I-BSI system under some road, ground, lane marker, traffic or weather conditions could lead to improper system operation. Always rely on your own operation to avoid accidents.

The I-BSI system helps alert the driver of other vehicles in adjacent lanes when changing lanes, and helps assist the driver to return the vehicle to the center of the traveling lane.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The I-BSI system uses radar sensors O 1 installed near the rear bumper to detect other vehicles in an adjacent lane. In addition to the radar sensors, the I-BSI system uses a camera O 2 installed behind the windshield to monitor the lane markers of your traveling lane.

Detection zone

The radar sensors can detect vehicles on either side of your vehicle within the detection zone shown as illustrated.

Thedetection zone starts from the outside mirror of your vehicle and extends approximately 10ft (3.0m) behind the rear bumper, and approximately 10ft (3.0 m) sideways.

- 2. Blind Spot Warning (BSW) indicator
- 3. Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention (I-BSI) indicator
- 4. Dynamic driver assistance switch (models without ProPILOT Assist)
- 5. ProPILOT Assist switch (models with ProPILOT Assist)

## I-BSI SYSTEM OPERATION

The I-BSI system operates above approximately 37 mph (60 km/h).

If the radar sensors detect a vehicle in the detection zone, the side indicator light (1) illuminates.

If the turn signal is then activated, the system chimes (twice) and the side indicator light flashes. The side indicator light continues to flash until the detected vehicle leaves the detection zone. The brightness of the side indicator light is adjusted automatically depending on the brightness of the ambient light.

If the I-BSI system is ON and your vehicle approaches a lane marker while another vehicle is in the detection zone, the system chimes (three times) and the side indicator light flashes. The I-BSI system activates to helpreturnthevehiclebacktothecenterof the driving lane. The I-BSI system operates regardless of turn signal usage.

## NOTE:

- · I-BSI warning and system application will only be activated if the side indicator light is already illuminated when your vehicle approaches a lane marker. If another vehicle comes into the detection zone after your vehicle has crossed a lane marker, no I-BSI warning or system application will be activated. For additional information, see 'I-BSI driving situations' (P. 5-50).
- · The I-BSI system is typically activated earlier than the Intelligent Lane Intervention (I-LI) system when your vehicle is approaching a lane marker.

To turn on the I-BSI system, push the ProPILOT Assist switch on the steering wheel (models with ProPILOT Assist) or the dynamic driver assistance switch (models without ProPILOT Assist) after starting the EV system. The I-BSI indicator will illuminate. Push the ProPILOT Assist switch or the dynamic driver assistance switch again to turn off the I-BSI system. The I-BSI indicator will turn off.

## INTELLIGENT CRUISE CONTROL (ICC) (for vehicles without ProPILOT Assist) (if so equipped)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use of the ICC system could result in serious injury or death.

- · TheICCsystemisonlyanaidtoassist the driver and is not a collision warning or avoidance device. It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times.
- · Always observe posted speed limits and do not set the speed over them.
- · Always drive carefully and attentively when using the ICC system. Read and understand the Owner's Manual thoroughly before using the ICC system. To avoid serious injury or death, do not rely on the system to prevent accidents or to control the vehicle's speed in emergency situations. Do not use the ICC system except in appropriate road and traffic conditions.

- · In the conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode, a warning chime will not sound to warn you if you are too close to the vehicle ahead. Pay special attention to the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead of you or a collision could occur

## NOTE:

## For vehicles equipped with ProPILOT Assist, see 'ProPILOT Assist' (P. 5-91)

The ICC system maintains a selected distance from the vehicle in front of you within the speed range of 0 to 90 mph (0 to 144 km/h) up to the set speed. The set speed canbeselectedbythedriverbetween20to 90 mph (32 to 144 km/h).

The vehicle travels at a set speed when the road ahead is clear.

The ICC system can be set to one of two cruise control modes:

- · Vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode: For maintaining a selected distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you up to the present speed
- · Conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode: For cruising at a preset speed

Push the ICC switch O A to choose the cruise control mode between the vehicleto-vehicle distance control mode and the conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode.

Once a control mode is activated, it cannot be changed to the other cruise control mode. To change the mode, push the ICC switch O A oncetoturnthesystemoff.Then push the ICC switch O A again to turn the system back on and select the desired cruise control mode.

Always confirm the setting in the ICC system display.

For the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode, see 'Vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode' (P. 5-69).

For the conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode, see 'Conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode' (P. 5-86).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## HOWTOSELECTTHE CRUISE CONTROL MODE

Selecting the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode: To choose the vehicle-tovehicle distance control mode O 1 , quickly push and release the ICC switch O A .

Selecting the conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode: To choose the conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode O 2 , push and hold the ICC switch O A for longer than approximately 1.5 seconds. For additional information, see 'Conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode' (P. 5-86).

## VEHICLE-TO-VEHICLE DISTANCE CONTROL MODE

In the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode, the ICC system automatically maintains a selected distance from the vehicle traveling in front of you according to that vehicle's speed (up to the set speed), or at the set speed when the road ahead is clear.

The ICC system is intended to enhance the operation of the vehicle when following a vehicle traveling in the same lane and direction.

If the radar sensor O B detects a slower moving vehicle ahead, the system will reduce the vehicle speed so that your vehicle follows the vehicle in front at the selected distance.

The system automatically controls the throttle and applies the brakes (up to approximately 40% of vehicle braking power) if necessary.

The detection range of the sensor is approximately 650 ft (200 m) ahead.

VEHICLE-TO-VEHICLE DISTANCE CONTROL MODE OPERATION

<!-- image -->

The vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode is designed to maintain a selected distance from the vehicle in front of you

and can reduce the speed to match a slower vehicle ahead. The system will decelerate the vehicle as necessary and if the vehicle ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle decelerates to a standstill. However, the ICC system can only apply up to 40% of the vehicle's total braking power.

This system should only be used when traffic conditions allow vehicle speeds to remain fairly constant or when vehicle speeds change gradually. If a vehicle moves into the traveling lane ahead or if a vehicle traveling ahead rapidly decelerates, the distance between vehicles may become closer because the ICC system cannot decelerate the vehicle quickly enough. If this occurs, the ICC system will sound a warning chime and blink the system display to notify the driver to take necessary action.

The system will cancel and a warning chime will sound if the speed is below approximately 15 mph (24 km/h) and a vehicle is not detected ahead. The system will also disengage when the vehicle goes above the maximum set speed.

For additional information, see 'Approach warning' (P. 5-77).

The following items are controlled in the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode:

- · When there are no vehicles traveling ahead, the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode maintains the speed set by the driver. The set speed range is between approximately 20 and 90 mph (32 and 144 km/h).
- · When there is a vehicle traveling ahead, the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode adjusts the speed to maintain the distance, selected by the driver, from the vehicle ahead. If the vehicle ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle decelerates to a standstill within the limitations of the system.Thesystemwillcancelonceitjudges a standstill with a warning chime.
- · When the vehicle traveling ahead has moved out from its lane of travel, the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode accelerates and maintains vehicle speed up to the set speed.

The ICC system does not control vehicle speed or warn you when you approach stationary and slow-moving vehicles. You must pay attention to vehicle operation to maintain proper distance from vehicles aheadwhenapproachingtollgatesortraffic congestion.

<!-- image -->

Whendriving on the freeway at a set speed andapproaching a slower traveling vehicle ahead,the ICC system will adjust the speed to maintain the distance, selected by the driver, from the vehicle ahead. If the vehicle ahead changes lanes or exits the freeway, the ICC system will accelerate and maintain the speed up to the set speed. Pay attention to the driving operation to maintain control of the vehicle as it accelerates to the set speed.

The vehicle may not maintain the set speed on winding or hilly roads. If this occurs, you will have to manually control the vehicle speed.

Normally when controlling the distance to a vehicle ahead, this system automatically accelerates or decelerates your vehicle according to the speed of the vehicle ahead. Depress the accelerator to properly accelerate your vehicle when acceleration is required for a lane change. Depress the brake pedal when deceleration is required to maintain a safe distance to the vehicle ahead due to its sudden braking or if a vehicle cuts in. Always stay alert when using the ICC system.

<!-- image -->

- 1. System set display with vehicle ahead
- 2. System set display without vehicle ahead

The driver sets the desired vehicle speed based on the road conditions. The ICC system maintains the set vehicle speed, similar to standard cruise control, as long as no vehicle is detected in the lane ahead. The ICC system displays the set speed.

## Vehicle detected ahead

When a vehicle is detected in the lane ahead, the ICC system decelerates the vehicle by controlling the throttle and applying the brakes to match the speed of a slower vehicle ahead. The system then controls the vehicle speed based on the speed of the vehicle ahead to maintain the driver selected distance.

## NOTE:

- · The stop lights of the vehicle come on when braking is performed by the ICC system.
- · When the brake operates, a noise may be heard. This is not a malfunction.

When a vehicle ahead is detected, the vehicle ahead detection indicator comes on. The ICC system will also display the set speed and selected distance.

## Vehicle ahead not detected

When a vehicle is no longer detected ahead, the ICC system gradually accelerates your vehicle to resume the previously set vehicle speed. The ICC system then maintains the set speed.

When a vehicle is no longer detected, the vehicle ahead detection indicator turns off.

If a vehicle ahead appears during acceleration to the set vehicle speed or any time the ICC system is in operation, the system controls the distance to that vehicle.

Whenavehicleis no longer detected under approximately 15 mph (24 km/h), the system will be canceled.

<!-- image -->

When passing another vehicle, the set speed indicator O B will flash when the vehicle speed exceeds the set speed. The vehicle detect indicator will turn off when the area ahead of the vehicle is open. When the pedal is released, the vehicle will return to the previously set speed.

Eventhoughyourvehiclespeedissetinthe ICC system, you can depress the accelerator pedal when it is necessary to accelerate your vehicle rapidly.

## How to change the set vehicle speed

Tocancelthepresetspeed, useoneofthe following methods:

- · Push the CANCEL switch. The set vehicle speed indicator will go out.
- · Tap the brake pedal. The set vehicle speed indicator will go out.
- · Turn the ICC switch off. The ICC indicators will go out.

To reset at a faster cruising speed, use one of the following methods:

- · Depress the accelerator pedal. When the vehicle attains the desired speed, push and release the SET- switch.
- · Push and hold the RES+ switch. The set vehicle speed will increase by approximately 5 mph (5 km/h).
- · Push, then quickly release the RES+ switch. Each time you do this, the set speed will increase by approximately 1 mph (1 km/h).

To reset at a slower cruising speed, use one of the following methods:

- · Lightly tap the brake pedal. When the vehicle attains the desired speed, push the SET- switch and release it.
- · Push and hold the SET- switch. The set vehicle speed will decrease by approximately 5 mph (5 km/h).
- · Push, then quickly release the SET- switch. Each time you do this, the set speed will decrease by approximately 1 mph (1 km/h).

To resume the preset speed, push and release the RES+ switch. The vehicle will resume the last set cruising speed when the vehicle speed is over 20 mph (32 km/h).

<!-- image -->

## How to change the set distance to the vehicle ahead

The distance to the vehicle ahead can be selected at any time depending on the traffic conditions.

Each time the DISTANCE switch O A is pushed, the set distance will change to long, middle, short and back to long again, in that sequence.

| Distance   | Approximate distance at 60 mph (97 km/h) [ft (m)]   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Long    | 200 (60)                                            |
| 2. Middle  | 150 (45)                                            |
| 3. Short   | 90 (30)                                             |

- · The distance to the vehicle ahead will change according to the vehicle speed. The higher the vehicle speed, the longer the distance.
- · The distance setting will remain at the current setting even if the EV system is restarted.

## Approach warning

If your vehicle comes closer to the vehicle ahead due to rapid deceleration of that vehicle or if another vehicle cuts in, the system warns the driver with the chime and ICC system display. Decelerate by depressing the brake pedal to maintain a safe vehicle distance if:

- · The chime sounds.
- · The vehicle ahead detection indicator blinks.

The warning chime may not sound in some cases when there is a short distance between vehicles. Some examples are:

- · When the vehicles are traveling at the same speed and the distance between vehicles is not changing.
- · Whenthevehicle ahead is traveling faster and the distance between vehicles is increasing.
- · When a vehicle cuts in near your vehicle.

The warning chime will not sound when:

- · The vehicle approaches other vehicles that are parked or moving slowly.
- · The accelerator pedal is depressed, overriding the system.

## NOTE:

The approach warning chime may sound and the system display may blink when the ICC sensor detects objects on the side of the vehicle or on the side of the road. This maycausetheICCsystemtodecelerate or accelerate the vehicle. The ICC sensor may detect these objects when the vehicle is driven on winding roads,narrow roads, hilly roads, or when entering or exiting a curve. In these cases you will have to manually control the proper distance ahead of your vehicle.

Also, the sensor sensitivity can be affected by vehicle operation (steering maneuver or driving position in the lane) or traffic or vehicle condition (for example, if a vehicle is being driven with some damage).

## Acceleration when passing

When the ICC system is engaged above 43 mph and following a slower vehicle (below ICC set speed), and the turn signal is activated to the left, the ICC system will automatically start to accelerate the vehicle to help initiate passing on the left and will begin to reduce the distance to the vehicle directly ahead. Only the left side

turn signal operates this feature. As the driver steers the vehicle and moves into the passing lane, if no vehicle is detected ahead the ICC system will continue to accelerate to the ICC system set speed. If another vehicle is detected ahead, then the vehicle will accelerate up to the following speed of that vehicle. If the vehicle is not steered into the left lane to pass, the acceleration will stop after a short time and regain the set following distance. Acceleration can be stopped at any point by depressing the brake pedal or the CANCEL switch on the steering wheel.

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

In order to reduce the risk of a collision that may result in serious injury or death,pleasebeawareofthefollowing:

- · This function is only activated with the left turn signal and will briefly accelerate the vehicle even if a lane change is not initiated. This can includenon-passingsituationssuchas left side exits.
- · Ensure that when passing another vehicle, the adjacent lane is clear before initiating the pass. Sudden changes in traffic may occur while passing.
- -Always manually steer or brake as needed
- -Never solely rely on the system

## Automatic cancellation

A chime sounds under the following conditions and the control is automatically canceled:

- · When the vehicle ahead is not detected and your vehicle is traveling below the speed of 15 mph (24 km/h)
- · When the system judges the vehicle is at a standstill
- · When the shift lever is not in the D (Drive) position or B mode
- · Whentheparkingbrakesystemisapplied
- · When the VDC system is turned off
- · WhenVDC operates
- · When distance measurement becomes impaired due to adhesion of dirt or obstruction to the sensor
- · When a wheel slips
- · When the radar signal is temporarily interrupted

## VEHICLE-TO-VEHICLE DISTANCE CONTROL MODE LIMITATIONS

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Listed below are the system limitations for the ICC system. Failure to operate the vehicle in accordance with these system limitations could result in serious injury or death.

- · The ICC system is primarily intended for use on straight, dry, open roads with light traffic. It is not advisable to use the ICC system in city traffic or congested areas.
- · The ICC system will not adapt automatically to road conditions. This system should be used in evenly flowing traffic. Do not use the system on roads with sharp curves, or on icy roads, in heavy rain or in fog.
- · As there is a performance limit to the distance control function, never rely solely on the ICC system. This system does not correct careless, inattentive or absentminded driving, or overcome poor visibility in rain, fog, or other bad weather. Decelerate the vehicle speed
- by depressing the brake pedal, depending on the distance to the vehicle ahead and the surrounding circumstancesinordertomaintainasafedistance between vehicles.
- · If the vehicle ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle decelerates to a standstill within the limitations of the system. The system will cancel once it judges that the vehicle has come to a standstill and sound a warning chime. To prevent the vehicle from moving, the driver must depress the brake pedal.
- · Always pay attention to the operation of the vehicle and be ready to manually control the proper following distance. The ICC system may not be able to maintain the selected distance between vehicles (following distance) or selected vehicle speed under some circumstances.
- · The system may not detect the vehicle in front of you in certain road or weather conditions. To avoid accidents, never use the ICC system under the following conditions:
- -Onroadswherethetrafficisheavy or there are sharp curves
- -On slippery road surfaces such as on ice or snow, etc.
- -During bad weather (rain, fog, snow, etc.)
- -When rain, snow or dirt adhere to the bumper around the distance sensor
- -On steep downhill roads (the vehicle may go beyond the set vehicle speed and frequent braking may result in overheating the brakes)
- -On repeated uphill and downhill roads
- -Whentraffic conditions make it difficult to keep a proper distance betweenvehiclesbecauseoffrequent acceleration or deceleration
- -Interference by other radar sources.
- · In some road or traffic conditions, a vehicle or object can unexpectedly come into the sensor detection zone and cause automatic braking. Always stay alert and avoid using the ICC system where not recommended in this warning section.

The radar sensor will not detect the following objects:

- · Stationary and slow-moving vehicles
- · Pedestrians or objects in the roadway
- · Oncoming vehicles in the same lane
- · Motorcycles traveling offset in the travel lane

The sensor generally detects the signals returnedfromthevehicleahead.Therefore, if the sensor cannot detect the reflection from the vehicle ahead, the ICC system may not maintain the selected distance.

Thefollowing are some conditions in which the sensor cannot properly detect a vehicle ahead and the system may not operate properly:

- · When snow or road spray from traveling vehicles reduces the sensor's detection.
- · Whenexcessively heavy baggage is loaded in the rear seat or the cargo area of your vehicle.

The ICC system is designed to automatically check the sensor's operation within the limitations of the system.

When the sensor is covered with dirt or is obstructed, the system will automatically be canceled. If the sensor is covered with ice, a transparent or translucent vinyl bag, etc., the ICC system may not detect them. In these instances, the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode may not cancel and may not be able to maintain the selected following distance from the vehicle ahead. Be sure to check and clean the sensor regularly.

The detection zone of the radar sensor is limited. A vehicle ahead must be in the detection zone for the vehicle-to-vehicle distance detection mode to maintain the selected distance from the vehicle ahead.

A vehicle ahead may move outside of the detection zone due to its position within the same lane of travel. Motorcycles may not be detected in the same lane ahead if they are traveling offset from the center line of the lane. A vehicle that is entering the lane ahead may not be detected until the vehicle has completely moved into the lane.

If this occurs, the ICC system may warn youbyblinkingthesystemindicatorand sounding the chime. The driver may have to manually control the proper distance away from the vehicle traveling ahead.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Whendrivingonsomeroads,suchaswinding, hilly, curved, narrow roads, or roads which are under construction, the ICC sensor may detect vehicles in a different lane, or may temporarily not detect a vehicle traveling ahead. This may cause the ICC system to decelerate or accelerate the vehicle.

The detection of vehicles may also be affected by vehicle operation (steering maneuver or traveling position in the lane, etc.) or vehicle condition.

If this occurs, the ICC system may warn youbyblinkingthesystemindicatorand sounding the chime unexpectedly. You will have to manually control the proper distance away from the vehicle traveling ahead.

## NOTE:

Steering Assist is not available in the conventional (fixed speed) cruise control mode.

- · Vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode: The ICC system maintains a selected distance from the vehicle in front of you within the speed range of 0 to 90 mph (0 to 144 km/h) up to the set speed. The set speed can be selected by the driver between 20 to 90 mph (30 to 144 km/h). When the vehicle ahead slows to a stop, your vehicle gradually decelerates to a standstill. When the vehicle is stopped, the ICC system maintains braking force to keep your vehicle stopped.

## NOTE:

When your vehicle is stopped for less than 3 seconds and the vehicle ahead begins to move, your vehicle will start moving again automatically.

- - When your vehicle is at a standstill for more than 3 seconds and the vehicle ahead begins to accelerate, push the RES+ switch or lightly depress the accelerator pedal. The ICC system starts to follow the vehicle ahead.
- - When no vehicle is detected ahead within the driver selected distance, the vehicle travels at the speed set by the driver. The speed must be above 20 mph (30 km/h) to use this function.

## NOTE:

Even if the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) with Pedestrian Detection setting is turned off by the driver using the 'Settings' menu in the vehicle information display, AEB with Pedestrian Detection will be automatically turned on when ICC is used.

## WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use of the ICC system could result in serious injury or death.

- · TheICCsystemisonlyanaidtoassist the driver and is not a collision warning or avoidance device. It is recommended for highway use only and it is not intended for city driving. It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times.
- · There are limitations to the ICC system capability. The ICC system does not function in all driving, traffic, weather,androadconditions.Itisthe driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, keep the vehicle in the travelinglane,andbeincontrolofthe vehicle at all times.
- · Always observe posted speed limits and do not set the speed over them.
- · TheICCsystemdoesnotreacttostationary and slow-moving vehicles.
- · Always drive carefully and attentively when using the ICC system. Read and understand the Owner's Manual thoroughly before using the ICC system. To avoid serious injury or death, do not rely on the system to prevent accidents or to control the vehicle's speed in emergency situations. Do not use the ICC system except in appropriate road and traffic conditions.

## ICC system operation

The ICC system is designed to maintain a selected distance from the vehicle in front of you and can reduce the speed to match a slower vehicle ahead. The system decelerates the vehicle as necessary and if the vehicle ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle decelerates to a standstill. However, the ICC system can only apply up to 40% of the vehicle's total braking power. This system should only be used when traffic conditions allow vehicle speeds to remain fairly constant or when vehicle speeds change gradually. If a vehicle moves into the traveling lane ahead or if a vehicle traveling aheadrapidly decelerates, the distance between vehicles may become closer because the ICC system cannot decelerate the vehicle quickly enough. If this occurs, the ICC system sounds a warning chime and blinks the system display to notify the driver to take necessary action.

The ICC system cancels and a warning chime sounds if the speed is below approximately 15 mph (25 km/h) and a vehicle is not detected ahead.

The ICC system operates as follows:

- · When there are no vehicles traveling ahead, the ICC system maintains the speed set by the driver. The set speed range is between approximately 20 and 90 mph (30 and 144 km/h).
- · When there is a vehicle traveling ahead, the ICC system adjusts the speed to maintain the distance, selected by the driver, from the vehicle ahead. If the vehicle ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle decelerates to a standstill. Once your vehicle stops, the ICC system keeps the vehicle stopped.
- · When your vehicle is stopped for less than 3 seconds and the vehicle ahead begins to move, your vehicle will start moving again automatically.
- · When your vehicle is at a standstill for more than 3 seconds and the vehicle ahead begins to accelerate, push the RES+ switch or lightly depress the accelerator pedal. The ICC system starts to follow the vehicle ahead.
- · When the vehicle traveling ahead moves to a different traveling lane, the ICC system accelerates and maintains vehicle speed up to the set speed.

The ICC system does not control vehicle speed or warn you when you approach stationary and slow-moving vehicles. You must pay attention to vehicle operation to maintain proper distance from vehicles aheadwhenapproachingtollgatesortraffic congestion.

Whendriving on the freeway at a set speed andapproaching a slower traveling vehicle ahead,theICCsystemadjuststhespeedto maintain the distance, selected by the driver, from the vehicle ahead. If the vehicle ahead changes lanes or exits the freeway, the ICC system accelerates and maintains the speed up to the set speed. Pay attention to the driving operation to maintain control of the vehicle as it accelerates to the set speed.

System set display with no vehicle detected ahead

## No vehicle detected ahead

The driver sets the desired vehicle speed based on the road conditions. The ICC system maintains the set vehicle speed, similar to standard cruise control, as long as no vehicle is detected in the lane ahead. The ICC system displays the set speed.

The vehicle may not maintain the set speed on winding or hilly roads. If this occurs, you will have to manually control the vehicle speed.

Normally when controlling the distance to a vehicle ahead, the system automatically accelerates or decelerates your vehicle according to the speed of the vehicle ahead.

Depress the accelerator to properly accelerate your vehicle when acceleration is required for a lane change.Depress the brake pedal when deceleration is required to maintain a safe distance to the vehicle ahead due to sudden braking or if a vehicle cuts in. Always stay alert when using the ICC system.

<!-- image -->

## Vehicle detected ahead System set display with vehicle ahead

When a vehicle is detected in the lane ahead, the ICC system decelerates the vehicle by controlling the throttle and applying the brakes to match the speed of a slower vehicle ahead. The ICC system then controls the vehicle speed based on the speed of the vehicle ahead to maintain the driver selected distance.

## NOTE:

- · The stop lights of the vehicle come on when braking is performed by the ICC system.
- · When the brake is applied by the system,anoise may be heard.This is not a malfunction.

When the ICC system detects a vehicle ahead, the vehicle ahead detection indicator and the speed control status indicator (distance control mode) illuminates (solid green ).

## Vehicle ahead stops

When the vehicle ahead decelerates to stop, your vehicle decelerates to a standstill. Once your vehicle stops, the ICC system automatically applies the brakes to keep the vehicle stopped. When your vehicle is at a standstill, the '(RES+) Press to start' message is displayed on the vehicle information display.

## NOTE:

When your vehicle stops for less than 3 seconds, your vehicle will automatically follow the vehicle as it accelerates from a stop.

## Vehicle ahead accelerates

When your vehicle is stopped and the vehicle ahead begins to accelerate, push the RES+switchorlightly depress the accelerator pedal. The ICC system starts to follow the vehicle ahead.

## Vehicle ahead not detected

When a vehicle is no longer detected ahead, the ICC system gradually accelerates your vehicle to resume the previously set vehicle speed. The ICC system then maintains the set speed.

When a vehicle is no longer detected, the vehicle ahead detection indicator turns off and the speed control status indicator (maintain speed control mode) illuminates (green outline ).

The ICC system gradually accelerates to the set speed, but you can depress the accelerator pedal to quickly accelerate. When a vehicle is no longer detected and your vehicle is traveling under approximately 15 mph (25 km/h), the ICC system automatically cancels.

<!-- image -->

When passing another vehicle, the set speed indicator O B flashes when the vehicle speed exceeds the set speed. The vehicle ahead detection indicator turns off whentheareaaheadofthevehicleis open. When the pedal is released, the vehicle returns to the previously set speed. Even though your vehicle speed is set in the ICC system, you can depress the accelerator pedal when it is necessary to accelerate your vehicle rapidly.

## Cut-in detection

If a vehicle moves into your traveling lane near your vehicle, the ICC system may inform the driver by flashing the vehicle ahead detection indicator.

## Approach warning

If your vehicle comes closer to the vehicle ahead due to rapid deceleration of that vehicle or if another vehicle cuts in, the system warns the driver with the chime and ICC system display. Decelerate by depressing the brake pedal to maintain a safe vehicle distance if:

- · The chime sounds.
- · The vehicle ahead detection indicator and set distance indicator blink.
- · You judge it necessary to maintain a safe distance.

The warning chime may not sound in somecaseswhenthereis a short distance between vehicles. Some examples are:

- · When the vehicles are traveling at the same speed and the distance between vehicles is not changing.
- · Whenthevehicle ahead is traveling faster and the distance between vehicles is increasing.
- · When a vehicle cuts in near your vehicle.

The warning chime will not sound when:

- · Your vehicle approaches other vehicles that are parked or moving slowly.
- · The accelerator pedal is depressed, overriding the system.

## NOTE:

Theapproachwarningchimemaysound and the system display may flash when the radar sensor detects objects on the side of the vehicle or on the side of the road. This may cause the ICC system to decelerate or accelerate the vehicle. The radar sensor may detect these objects when the vehicle is driven on winding, narrow, or hilly roads or when the vehicle is entering or exiting a curve. In these cases, you will have to manually control theproperdistanceaheadofyourvehicle. Also, the sensor sensitivity can be affected by vehicle operation (steering maneuverordriving position in the lane) or traffic or vehicle conditions (for example, if a vehicle is being driven with some damage).

## Acceleration when passing

When the ICC system is engaged above 44 mph and following a slower vehicle (below ICC set speed), and the turn signal is activated to the left, the ICC system will automatically start to accelerate the vehicle to help initiate passing on the left and will begin to reduce the distance to the vehicle directly ahead. Only the left side turn signal operates this feature. As the driver steers the vehicle and moves into the passing lane, if no vehicle is detected ahead the ICC system will continue to accelerate to the ICC system set speed. If another vehicle is detected ahead, then the vehicle will accelerate up to the following speed of that vehicle. If the vehicle is not steered into the left lane to pass, the acceleration will stop after a short time and regain the set followingdistance.Acceleration can be stopped at any point by depressing the brake pedal or the CANCEL switch on the steering wheel.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

In order to reduce the risk of a collision that may result in serious injury or death,pleasebeawareofthefollowing:

- · This function is only activated with the left turn signal and will briefly accelerate the vehicle even if a lane change is not initiated. This can includenon-passingsituationssuchas left side exits.
- · Ensure that when passing another vehicle, the adjacent lane is clear before initiating the pass. Sudden changes in traffic may occur while passing.
- -Always manually steer or brake as needed
- -Never solely rely on the system

## ICC system limitations

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Listed below are the system limitations for the ICC system. Failure to operate the vehicle in accordance with these system limitations could result in serious injury or death:

- · The ICC system is primarily intended for use on straight, dry, open roads with light traffic. It is not advisable to use the ICC system in city traffic or congested areas.
- · The ICC system will not adapt automatically to road conditions. This system should be used in evenly flowing traffic. Do not use the system on roads with sharp curves or on icy roads, in heavy rain or in fog.
- · As there is a performance limit to the distance control function, never rely solely on the ICC system. This system doesnotcorrect careless, inattentive or absentminded driving or overcome poor visibility in rain, fog, or other bad weather. Decelerate the vehicle speed by depressing the brake pedal, depending on the distance to the vehicle ahead and the surrounding circumstances in order to maintain a safe distance between vehicles.
- · When the ICC system automatically brings the car to a stop, your vehicle can automatically accelerate if the vehicle is stopped for less than approximately 3 seconds. Be prepared to stop your vehicle if necessary.
- · Always pay attention to the operation of the vehicle and be ready to manually control the proper following distance. The ICC system may not be able to maintain the selected distance between vehicles (following distance) or selected vehicle speed under some circumstances.
- · The system may not detect the vehicle in front of you in certain road or weather conditions. To avoid accidents, never use the ICC system under the following conditions:
- -On roads with heavy, high-speed traffic or sharp curves
- -On slippery road surfaces such as on ice or snow, etc.
- -During bad weather (rain, fog, snow, etc.)
- -When rain, snow or dirt adhere to the bumper around the distance sensor
- -On steep downhill roads (the vehicle may go beyondthesetvehicle speed and frequent braking may result in overheating the brakes)
- -On repeated uphill and downhill roads
- -Whentraffic conditions make it difficult to keep a proper distance betweenvehiclesbecauseoffrequent acceleration or deceleration
- -Interference by other radar sources
- · In some road or traffic conditions, a vehicle or object can unexpectedly come into the sensor detection zone and cause automatic braking. Always stay alert and avoid using the ICC system where not recommended in this warning section.

TheICCsystemwillnotdetectthefollowing objects:

- · Stationary or slow moving vehicles
- · Pedestrians or objects in the roadway
- · Oncoming vehicles in the same lane
- · Motorcycles traveling offset in the travel lane

Thefollowing are some conditions in which the radar sensor cannot properly detect a vehicle ahead and the system may not operate properly:

- · When the sensor detection is reduced (conditions such as rain, snow, fog, dust storms,sandstorms,androadsprayfrom other vehicles)
- · Driving on a steep downhill slope or roads with sharp curves
- · Driving on a bumpy road surface, such as an uneven dirt road
- · If dirt, ice, snow or other material is covering the radar sensor area
- · A complicated-shaped vehicle such as a car carrier trailer or flatbed truck/trailer is near the vehicle ahead
- · Interference by other radar sources
- · When excessively heavy baggage is loaded in the rear seat or cargo area of your vehicle

The ICC system is designed to automatically check the radar sensor's operation within the limitations of the system.

The detection zone of the radar sensor is limited. A vehicle ahead must be in the detection zone for the ICC system to maintain the selected distance from the vehicle ahead. A vehicle ahead may move outside of the detection zone due to its position within the same lane of travel. Motorcycles may not be detected in the same lane ahead if they are traveling offset from the center line of the lane. A vehicle that is entering the lane ahead may not be detected until the vehicle has completely moved into the lane.

If this occurs, the ICC system may warn you by blinking the system indicator and sounding the chime. The driver may have to manually control the proper distance away from the vehicle traveling ahead.

The ICC system (with ProPILOT Assist) uses a multi-sensing front camera. The following are some conditions in which the camera may not properly detect a vehicle and detection of a vehicle ahead may be delayed:

- · Poor visibility (conditions such as rain, snow, fog, dust storms, sandstorms, and road spray from other vehicles)
- · The camera area of the windshield is fogged up or covered with dirt, water drops, ice, snow, etc.
- · Strong light (for example, sunlight or high beams from oncoming vehicles) enters the front camera
- · A sudden change in brightness occurs (for example, when the vehicle enters or exits a tunnel or shaded area or lightning flashes)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Whendrivingonsomeroads,suchaswinding, hilly, curved, narrow roads, or roads which are under construction, the radar sensor may detect vehicles in a different lane, or may temporarily not detect a vehicle traveling ahead. This may cause the radar system to decelerate or accelerate the vehicle.

The detection of vehicles may also be affected by vehicle operation (steering maneuver or traveling position in the lane, etc.) or vehicle condition.

If this occurs, the ICC system may warn you by blinking the system indicator and sounding the chime unexpectedly. You will have to manually control the proper distance away from the vehicle traveling ahead.

## System Temporarily Unavailable

Always drive safely, pay attention to the operation of the vehicle, and manually control your vehicle appropriately.
- · The Steering Assist is intended for use on well-developed freeways or highways with gentle (moderate) curves. To avoid risk of an accident, do not use this system on local or non-highway roads.
- · The Steering Assist only steers the vehicle to maintain its position in the center of a lane. The vehicle will not steer to avoid objects in the road in front of the vehicle or to avoid a vehicle moving into your lane.
- · It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, keep the vehicle in the traveling lane, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Never take your hands off the steering wheel whendriving. Always keep your hands on the steering wheel and drive your vehicle safely.
- · Always drive carefully and attentively when using the Steering Assist. Read and understand the Owner's Manual thoroughly before using the Steering Assist. To avoid serious injury or death, do not rely on the system to prevent accidents or to control the vehicle's speed in emergency situations. Do not use the Steering Assist except in appropriate road and traffic conditions.

## Steering Assist operation

The Steering Assist controls the steering system to help keep your vehicle near the center of the lane when driving. The Steering Assist is combined with the Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) system. For additional information, see 'Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) (with ProPILOT Assist)' (P. 5-103).

The Steering Assist can be activated when the following conditions are met:

- · The ICC system is activated.
- · Lane markers on both sides are clearly detected.
- · A vehicle ahead is detected (when the vehicle is driven at speeds under 37 mph [60 km/h]).
- · The driver grips the steering wheel.
- · The vehicle is driven at the center of the lane.
- · The turn signals are not operated.
- · The windshield wiper is not operated in the high (HI) speed operation (the steering assist function is disabled after the wiper operates for approximately 10 seconds).

## Intelligent Lane Intervention (I-LI)

Whenacurveorstrongcrosswindexceeds the capabilities of the Steering Assist and your vehicle approaches either the left or the right side of the traveling lane, a warning chime sounds and the I-LI indicator light (orange) on the instrument panel flashes to alert the driver. Then, the I-LI system automatically applies the brakes for a short period of time to help assist the driver to return the vehicle to the center of the traveling lane. This action is in addition to any Steering Assist actions.

Hands on detection

<!-- image -->

WhentheSteeringAssistis activated,it monitors the driver's steering wheel operation.

If the steering wheel is not operated or the driver takes his/her hands off the steering wheel for a period of time, the warning O 1 appears in the vehicle information display.

If the driver does not operate the steering wheel after the warning has been displayed, an audible alert sounds and the warning flashes in the vehicle information display, followed by a quick brake application to request the driver to take control of the vehicle again.

If the driver still does not respond, the ProPILOT Assist turns on the hazard flasher and slows the vehicle to a complete stop.

The driver can cancel the deceleration at any time by steering, braking, accelerating, or operating the ProPILOT Assist switch.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Steering Assist is not a system for hands-free driving. Always keep your hands on the steering wheel and drive your vehicle safely. Failure to do so could cause a collision resulting in serious personal injury or death.

## NOTE:

If the driver lightly touches (instead of firmly grips) the steering wheel, the steering torque sensor may not detect the driver's hand(s) on the wheel and a sequence of warnings may occur. When the driver holds and operates the steering wheel again, the warnings turn off.

## AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING (AEB) WITH PEDESTRIAN DETECTION

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use of the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system could result in serious injury or death.

- · The AEB with Pedestrian Detection system is a supplemental aid to the driver. It is not a replacement for the driver's attention to traffic conditions or responsibility to drive safely. It cannot prevent accidents due to carelessness or dangerous driving techniques.
- · The AEB with Pedestrian Detection systemdoesnotfunctioninalldriving, traffic, weather and road conditions.

<!-- image -->

The AEB with Pedestrian Detection system can assist the driver when there is a risk of aforwardcollision with the vehicle ahead in the traveling lane or with a pedestrian ahead in the traveling lane.

The AEB with Pedestrian Detection system uses a radar sensor located on the front of the vehicle O B to measure the distance to the vehicle ahead in the same lane. For pedestrians, the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system uses a camera installed behind the windshield O A in addition to the radar sensor.

AEB WITH PEDESTRIAN DETECTION SYSTEM OPERATION 1. Vehicle ahead detection indicator

<!-- image -->

- 2. AEB with Pedestrian Detection emergency warning indicator
- 3. AEB with Pedestrian Detection system warning light

The AEB with Pedestrian Detection system operates at speeds above approximately 3 mph (5 km/h). For the pedestrian detection function, the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system operates at speeds between6-37mph(10-60km/h).

If a risk of a forward collision with a vehicle is detected, the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system will first provide a warning to the driver by flashing the vehicle ahead detection indicator and providing an audible alert. In addition, the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system applies partial braking. If the driver applies the brakes quickly and forcefully, but the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system detects that there is still the possibility of a forward collision, the system will automatically increase the braking force.

If the risk of a collision becomes imminent andthedriverdoesnottakeaction,theAEB with Pedestrian Detection system issues the second warning to the driver by flashing the AEB with Pedestrian Detection emergency warning indicator (red), providing an audible warning,and then automatically applies harder braking.

If a risk of a forward impact with a pedestrian is detected, the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system will provide a warning to the driver by flashing the AEB with Pedestrian Detection emergency warning indicator (red), provides an audible alert and the system will apply partial braking. If the driver applies the brakes quickly and forcefully but the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system detects that there is still the possibility of a forward impact with a pedestrian, the system will automatically increase the braking force. If the risk of collision becomes imminent and the driver does not take action, the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system automatically applies harder braking.

## NOTE:

## The vehicle's brake lights come on when any braking is performed by the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system.

Depending on vehicle speed and distance to the vehicle or pedestrian ahead, as well asdriving and roadway conditions,the system may help the driver avoid a forward collision or may help mitigate the consequences if a collision should be unavoid-

able. If the driver is handling the steering wheel,accelerating or braking,the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system will function later or will not function.

Theautomaticbrakingwillceaseunderthe following conditions:

- · When the steering wheel is turned to avoid a collision.
- · Whentheaccelerator pedal is depressed.
- · When there is no longer a vehicle or a pedestrian detected ahead.

If the AEB with Pedestrian Detection system has stopped the vehicle, the vehicle will remain at a standstill for approximately 2 seconds before the brakes are released.

## INTELLIGENT DRIVER ALERTNESS (I-DA) (if so equipped)

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and instructions for proper use of the I-DA system could result in serious injury or death.

- · The I-DA system is only a warning to inform the driver of a potential lack of driver attention or drowsiness. It will not steer the vehicle or prevent loss of control.
- · The I-DA system does not detect and provide an alert of the driver's lack of attention or fatigue in every situation.
- · It's the driver's responsibility to:
- -stay alert,
- -drive safely,
- -keep the vehicle in the traveling lane,
- -be in control of the vehicle at all times,
- -avoid driving when tired,
- -avoid distractions (texting, etc.).

TheI-DA system helps alert the driver if the system detects a lack of attention or driving fatigue.

The system monitors driving style and steering behavior over a period of time, and it detects changes from the normal pattern. If the system detects that driver attention is decreasing over a period of time, the system uses audible and visual warnings to suggest that the driver take a break.

<!-- image -->

## I-DA SYSTEM OPERATION

If the system detects driver fatigue or that driver attention is decreasing, the message 'Take a break?' appears in the vehicle information display and a chime sounds whenthe vehicle is driven at speeds above 37 mph (60 km/h).

The system continuously monitors driver attention and can provide multiple warnings per trip.

The system resets and starts reassessing driving style and steering behavior when the power switch is cycled from the ON to the OFF position and back to the ON position.

HOWTOENABLE/DISABLE THE I-DA SYSTEM

<!-- image -->

Perform the following steps to enable or disable the I-DA system.

- 1. Press the button until 'Settings' displays in the vehicle information display. Use the button to select 'Driver Assistance.' Then press the OK button.
- 2. Select 'Driver Attention Alert' and use the OK button to turn the system on or off.

## NOTE:

Thesettingwill be retained even if the EV system is restarted.

## I-DA SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

To turn on the ECO mode, push the ECO switch. The ECO mode indicator appears on the vehicle information display.

To turn off the ECO mode, push the ECO switch again. The ECO mode indicator will turn off.

- · The selection of the ECO mode (ON or OFF)is retained even when the EVsystem is restarted.

- · When the ECO mode is turned off, driving performance is changed. Before turning off the ECO mode, ensure it is safe to do so, release the accelerator pedal and operate the ECO switch.
- · Turnoff the ECO modewhenacceleration is required, such as when:
- - driving with a heavy load of passengers or cargo in the vehicle.
- - driving on a steep uphill slope.
- · When the cruise control is operated, the vehicle makes it a priority to maintain a constantspeed.Thedrivingrangewillnot be extended even if the ECO mode indicator appears.

## NOTE:

Selecting this drive mode will not necessarily improve power economy as many driving factors influence its effectiveness.

## ECO DRIVE REPORT

The ECO Drive Report appears for approximately 30 seconds after placing the power switch in the OFF position, driving the vehicle for more than 0.3 miles (500 m), and pressing the button on the steering wheel.

<!-- image -->

- 1. Previous 5 times (History)
- Displays the average energy economy for the previous 5 times
- 2. Current energy economy
- Displays the most recent average energy economy
- 3. Best energy economy
- Displays the best energy economy of the past history
- 4. Regenerated energy (mileage)
- Displays the amount of regenerated energy stored in the Li-ion battery in one trip in terms of distance

If the vehicle has been driven mostly on downhill roads, more energy is regenerated. This may cause the regenerated energy (mileage) (4) to show a longer distance than the vehicle was driven or the current energy economy (2) to show '99.9 miles/kWh.'

When the button is pressed while the ECO Drive Report is shown, the display switches to the timer display. Either display will continue to show for another 30 seconds after the button is pressed. If the doors are locked after placing the power switch in the OFF position, the display turns off before the preset time.

In the 'Settings' menu, you can program the ECO Drive Report to not appear when the power switch is placed in the OFF position. For additional information, see 'Vehicle information display' (P. 2-26).

## INCREASING POWER ECONOMY

The vehicle range varies depending upon the following factors:

- · Speed
- · Vehicle load
- · Electrical load from vehicle accessories
- · Traffic and road conditions

## NISSAN recommends the following driving habits to help maximize vehicle range: Before driving:

- · Follow the recommended periodic maintenance.
- · Keeptiresinflated to the correct pressure.
- · Keep wheels in correct alignment.
- · Pre-heat or pre-cool the interior cabin while the vehicle is charging.
- · Remove unnecessary cargo from the vehicle.

## While driving:

- · Drive in ECO mode.
- - The ECO mode helps reduce power consumption by reducing acceleration whencomparedtothesameaccelerator pedal position in the D (Drive) position (normal mode).
- · Drive at a constant speed. Maintain cruising speeds with a constant accelerator position or by using cruise control when appropriate.
- · Accelerate slowly and smoothly. Gently press and release the accelerator pedal for acceleration and deceleration.
- · Drive at moderate speeds on the highway.
- · Avoid frequent stopping and braking. Maintain a safe distance behind other vehicles.
- · Turn off the air conditioner/heater when it is not necessary.
- · Select a moderate temperature setting for heating or cooling to help reduce power consumption.
- · Use the air conditioner/heater and close windowstoreducedragwhencruisingat a highway speed.
- · Release the accelerator pedal to slow down and do not apply the brakes when traffic and road conditions allow.
- - This vehicle is equipped with a regenerative brake system. The primary purpose of the regenerative brake system is to provide some power to recharge the Li-ion battery and extend driving range. A secondary benefit is 'engine braking' that operates based on Li-ion battery conditions. In the D (Drive) position, when the accelerator pedal is released, the regenerative brake system provides some deceleration and some power to the Li-ion battery.

## PARKING/PARKING ON HILLS

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Do not stop or park the vehicle over flammable materials such as dry grass, waste paper or rags. They may ignite and cause a fire.
- · Never leave the vehicle in the READY to drive mode while the vehicle is unattended.
- · Safe parking procedures require that both the parking brake be applied andthevehicleplacedintheparkposition. Failure to do so could cause the vehicle to move unexpectedly or roll away and result in an accident.
- · Do not leave children unattended inside the vehicle. They could unknowingly activate switches or controls or make the vehicle move. Unattended children could become involved in serious accidents.

- · To help avoid risk of injury or death through unintended operation of the vehicle and/or its systems, do not leave children, people who require theassistanceofothersorpetsunattended in your vehicle. Additionally, the temperature inside a closed vehicle on a warm day can quickly becomehighenoughtocauseasignificant risk of injury or death to people and pets.

<!-- image -->

- 1. Firmly apply the parking brake.
- 2. Push the P (Park) position switch on the shift lever.
- 3. To help prevent the vehicle from rolling into the street when parked on a slope, it is a good practice to turn the wheels as illustrated.
- · HEADED DOWNHILL WITH CURB O 1 : Turn the wheels into the curb and move the vehicle forward until the curb side wheel gently touches the curb.
- · HEADED UPHILL WITH CURB O 2 :
- Turn the wheels away from the curb and move the vehicle back until the curb side wheel gently touches the curb.
- · HEADED UPHILL OR DOWNHILL, NO CURB O 3 :
- Turn the wheels toward the side of the road so the vehicle will move away from the center of the road if it moves.
- 4. Place the power switch in the OFF position.

## POWERSTEERING SYSTEM

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · If the READY to drive indicator light is off while driving, the power assist for the steering will not work. Steering will be harder to operate.
- · When the power steering warning light illuminates while the READY to drive indicator light is on, the power assist for the steering will cease operation. You will still have control of the vehicle but the steering will be harder to operate.

The power steering system is designed to provide power assistance while driving to operate the steering wheel with less effort.

When the steering wheel is operated repeatedly or continuously while parking or driving at a very low speed, the power assist for the steering wheel will be reduced. This is to prevent overheating of the power steering system and help protect it from getting damaged. When the power assistance is reduced, steering wheel operation will become harder. When the temperature of the power steering system goes down, the power assistance level will return to normal. Avoid repeating such steering wheel operations that could cause the power steering system to overheat.

You may hear a noise when the steering wheel is operated quickly. However, this is not a malfunction.

If the power steering warning light illuminates while the READY to drive indicator light is on, it may indicate the power steering system is not functioning properly and may need servicing. Have the power steering system checked. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service. For additional information, see 'Power steering warning light' (P. 2-23).

Thepowerassistforsteeringstopsoperating when both the power steering warning light and READY to drive indicator light are illuminated. You will still have control of the vehicle. However, greater steering effort is needed, especially in sharp turns and at low speeds.

## BRAKE SYSTEM

## BRAKE PRECAUTIONS

This vehicle is equipped with two braking systems:

- 1. Hydraulic brake system
- 2. Regenerative brake system

## Hydraulic brake system

Thehydraulic brake system is similar to the brakes used on conventional vehicles.

The brake system has two separate hydraulic circuits. If one circuit malfunctions, you will still have braking at two wheels.

## Regenerative brake system

The primary purpose of the regenerative brake system is to provide some power to help recharge the Li-ion battery and extend driving range. A secondary benefit is 'engine braking' that operates based on battery conditions.

In the D (Drive) range, when the accelerator is released, the regenerative brake system provides some deceleration and generates power for the Li-ion battery. Power is also generated when the brake pedal is applied.

When you put the shift lever in the B mode and take your foot off the accelerator pedal, more regenerative brake is applied than in the D (Drive) position. However, during high-speed driving you may feel that regenerative brake provides less deceleration than the engine braking in an ordinary vehicle. This is normal.

Less deceleration is provided by the regenerative brake system when the Li-ion battery is fully charged. Regenerative brake is automatically reduced when the Li-ion battery is fully charged to prevent the Li-ion battery from becoming overcharged. Regenerative brake is also automatically reduced when the battery temperature is high/low (indicated by the red/blue zones on the battery temperature gauge) to prevent Li-ion battery damage.

The brake pedal should be used to slow or stop the vehicle depending on traffic or road conditions. The vehicle brakes are not affected by regenerative brake system operation.

## NOTE:

- · When applying the regenerative brakes, you may hear a sound coming from the regenerative brake system.This is a normal operating characteristic of an EV.
- · If the power switch position is in a position other than ON or READY to drive, you can stop the vehicle by depressing the brake pedal. However, greater foot pressure on the brake pedal will be required to stop the vehicle, and the stopping distance will be longer.
- · When depressing the brake pedal, the brake pedal feel will not be smooth or may change when the cooperative regenerative brake system activates. However, the electronically controlled brake system is operating normally and this does not indicate a malfunction.

## Using the brakes

Avoid resting your foot on the brake pedal while driving. This will cause overheating of the brakes, wearing out of the brake pads and shoes faster, and will reduce driving range.

To help reduce brake wear, and to prevent the brakes from overheating,reduce speed and select B mode before going down a slope or long grade. Overheated brakes may reduce braking performance and could result in loss of vehicle control.

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

- · While driving on a slippery surface, becarefulwhenbrakingoraccelerating. Abrupt braking or accelerating couldcausethewheelstoskid,which could result in an accident.
- · If the brake pedal is depressed with the EV system OFF, you may feel an increased brake pedal effort and a decreased pedal stroke. If the BRAKE warning light does not illuminate and the brake pedal feels like it has returned to its normal state after the EV system is started, this indicates that there is no malfunction and the vehicle can be operated normally.

## Wet brakes

When the vehicle is washed or driven through water, the brakes may get wet. As a result, the braking distance will be longer and the vehicle may pull to one side during braking.

To dry brakes, drive the vehicle at a safe speed while lightly tapping the brake pedal to heat up the brakes. Do this until the brakes return to normal. Avoid driving the vehicle at high speeds until the brakes have dried.

## Parking brake break-in

Breakintheparkingbrakeshoeswhenever the stopping effect of the parking brake is weakened or whenever the parking brake shoes and/or rotors are replaced, in order to assure the best braking performance.

This procedure is described in the Genuine NISSAN Service Manual, and it can be performed by a certified repair facility. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer.

## ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS)

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · TheABSisasophisticateddevice,but it cannot prevent accidents resulting from careless or dangerous driving techniques. It can help maintain vehicle control during braking on slippery surfaces. Remember that stopping distances on slippery surfaces will be longer than on normal surfaces even with ABS. Stopping distances may also be longer on rough, gravel or snow covered roads, or if you are using tire chains. Always maintainasafedistancefromthevehicle in front of you. Ultimately, the driver is responsible for safety.
- · Tire type and condition may also affect braking effectiveness.
- -When replacing tires, install the specified size of tires on all four wheels.
- -For additional information, see 'Wheels and tires' (P. 8-25).

The ABS controls the brakes so the wheels do not lock during hard braking or when braking on slippery surfaces. The system detects the rotation speed at each wheel

and varies the brake fluid pressure to prevent each wheel from locking and sliding. By preventing each wheel from locking, the system helps the driver maintain steering control and helps to minimize swerving and spinning on slippery surfaces.

## Using the system

Depress the brake pedal and hold it down. Depress the brake pedal with firm steady pressure, but do not pump the brakes. The Anti-lock Braking System will operate to prevent the wheels from locking up. Steer the vehicle to avoid obstacles.

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

Do not pump the brake pedal. Doing so may result in increased stopping distances.

## Self-test feature

The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) includes electronic sensors, electric pumps, hydraulic solenoids and a computer. The computer has a built-in diagnostic feature that tests the system each time you place the power switch in the READY to drive position and move the vehicle at a low speed in forward or reverse. When the self-

test occurs, you may hear a 'clunk' noise and/or feel a pulsation in the brake pedal. This is normal and does not indicate a malfunction. If the computer senses a malfunction, it switches the ABS off and illuminates the ABS warning light on the instrument panel. The brake system then operates normally, but without anti-lock assistance.

If the ABS warning light illuminates during the self-test or while driving, have the vehicle checked. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.

## Normal operation

The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) operates at speeds above 3 to 6 mph (5 to 10 km/h). The speed varies according to road conditions.

When the ABS senses that one or more wheelsareclosetolockingup,theactuator rapidly applies and releases hydraulic pressure. This action is similar to pumping the brakes very quickly. You may feel a pulsation in the brake pedal and hear a noise from under the hood or feel a vibration from the actuator when it is operating.

This is normal and indicates that the ABS is operating properly. However, the pulsation mayindicate that road conditions are hazardous and extra care is required while driving.

## BRAKE ASSIST

When the force applied to the brake pedal exceeds a certain level, the Brake Assist is activated generating greater braking force than a conventional brake booster even with light pedal force.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

The Brake Assist is only an aid to assist braking operation and is not a collision warning or avoidance device. It is the drivers responsibility to stay alert, drive safely and be in control of the vehicle at all times.

## VEHICLE DYNAMIC CONTROL (VDC) SYSTEM

The VDC system uses various sensors to monitor driver inputs and vehicle motion. Under certain driving conditions, the VDC system helps to perform the following functions.

- · Controls brake pressure to reduce wheel slip on one slipping drive wheel so power is transferred to a drive wheel on the same axle that is not slipping.
- · Controls brake pressure and traction motor output to reduce drive wheel slip based on vehicle speed (traction control function).
- · Controls brake pressure at individual wheelsandtraction motor output to help the driver maintain control of the vehicle in the following conditions:
- - Understeer (vehicle tends to not follow the steered path despite increased steering input).
- - Oversteer (vehicle tends to spin due to certain road or driving conditions).

The VDC system can help the driver maintain control of the vehicle, but it cannot prevent loss of vehicle control in all driving situations.

When the VDC system operates, the indicator light in the instrument panel flashes. When the indicator light flashes, note the following items:

- · The road may be slippery or the system may determine some action is required to help keep the vehicle on the steered path.
- · You may feel a pulsation in the brake pedal and hear a noise or vibration from under the hood. This is normal and indicates that the VDC system is working properly.
- · Adjust your speed and driving according to the road conditions.

For additional information, see 'Slip indicator light' (P. 2-24) and 'Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) OFF indicator light' (P. 2-24).

If a malfunction occurs in the system, the indicator light illuminates in the vehicle information display. The VDC system automatically turns off when this indicator light is lit.

The vehicle information display is used to turn off the VDC system. The VDC OFF indicator light , along with the AEB with Pedestrian Detection and RAB warning lights illuminate to indicate that the VDC, AEB with Pedestrian Detection, and RAB systems are off. When the vehicle information display is used to turn off the system, the VDC system still operates to prevent one drive wheel from slipping by transferring power to a non-slipping wheel. The

indicator light flashes if this occurs.

- All otherVDC functions are off and the indicator light will not flash. The VDC system is automatically reset to on when the power switch is placed in the OFF position thenbacktotheONposition.Foradditional information, see 'Vehicle information display' (P. 2-26).

Thecomputerhasabuilt-indiagnosticfeature that tests the system each time you start the EV and move the vehicle forward or in reverse at a slow speed. When the self-test occurs, you may hear a 'clunk' noise and/or feel a pulsation in the brake pedal. This is normal and is not an indication of a malfunction.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · The VDC system is designed to help the driver maintain stability but does not prevent accidents due to abrupt steering operation at high speeds or by careless or dangerous driving techniques. Reduce vehicle speed and be especially careful when driving and cornering on slippery surfaces and always drive carefully.
- · Do not modify the vehicle's suspension. If suspension parts such as shock absorbers, struts, springs, stabilizer bars, bushings and wheels are not NISSAN recommended for your vehicle or are extremely deteriorated the VDC system may not operate properly. This could adversely affect vehicle handling performance, and the
- indicator light may flash or the indicator light may illuminate.
- · If brake related parts such as brake pads, rotors and calipers are not NISSAN recommended or are extremely deteriorated, the VDC system may not operate properly and the indicator light may illuminate.
- · If traction motor control related parts are not NISSAN recommended or are extremely deteriorated, the indicator light may illuminate.
- · When driving on extremely inclined surfaces such as higher banked corners, the VDC system may not operate properly and the indicator light may illuminate. Do not drive on these types of roads.
- · When driving on an unstable surface such as a turntable, ferry, elevator or ramp, the indicator light may illuminate. This is not a malfunction. Restart the EV system after driving onto a stable surface.
- · If wheels or tires other than the NISSAN recommended ones are used, theVDCsystemmaynotoperateproperly and the indicator light may illuminate.
- · The VDC system is not a substitute for winter tires or tire chains on a snow covered road.

## BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION

During braking while driving through turns, the system optimizes the distribution of force to each of the four wheels depending on the radius of the turn.

## CHASSIS CONTROL

The chassis control is an electric control modulethat includes the following functions:

- · Intelligent Trace Control
- · Intelligent Ride Control

<!-- image -->

## INTELLIGENT TRACE CONTROL (I-TC)

This system senses driving based on the driver's steering and acceleration/braking patterns, and controls brake pressure at individual wheels to aid tracing at corners and help smooth vehicle response.

The I-TC can be set to on (enabled) or off (disabled) through the vehicle information display 'Settings' page. For additional information, see 'Vehicle information display' (P. 2-26).

When the VDC system is turned off in the vehicle information display, the I-TC is also turned off.

Whenthe I-TC is operated and the 'Chassis Control' mode is selected in the vehicle information display, the I-TC graphics are shown in the vehicle information display. For additional information, see 'Vehicle information display' (P. 2-26).

If the 'Chassis Control System Error: See Owner's Manual' warning message appears in the vehicle information display, it

may indicate that the I-TC is not functioning properly. Have the system checked as soon as possible. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

## The I-TC may not be effective depending on the driving condition. Always drive carefully and attentively.

When the I-TC is operating, you may feel a pulsation in the brake pedal, hear a noise and sense slight deceleration. This is normalandindicates that the I-TC is operating properly.

Evenif the I-TC is turned off, some functions will remain on to assist the driver (for example, avoidance scenes).

## ACTIVE RIDE CONTROL (ARC)

This system senses upper body motion (based on wheel speed information) and controls motor torque. This will enhance ride comfort in effort to restrain uncomfortable upper body movement when passing over undulated road surfaces. This system comes into effect above 25 mph (40 km/h).

When the VDC system is turned off in the vehicle information display, the ARC is also turned off.

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

The ARC may not be effective depending on the driving condition. Always drive carefully and attentively.

Whenthe ARC is operating, you may hear a noise and sense slight deceleration. This is normal and indicates that the ARC is operating properly.

If the 'Chassis Control System Error: See Owner's Manual' warning message appears in the vehicle information display, it may indicate that the ARC is not functioning properly. Have the system checked as soon as possible. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.

## HILL START ASSIST SYSTEM

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Never rely solely on the hill start assist system to prevent the vehicle from moving backward on a hill. Always drive carefully and attentively. Depress the brake pedal when the vehicle is stopped on a steep hill. Be especially careful when stopped on a hill on frozen or muddy roads. Failure to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards may result in a loss of control of the vehicle and possible serious injury or death.
- · The hill start assist system is not designed to hold the vehicle at a standstill on a hill. Depress the brake pedal when the vehicle is stopped on a steep hill. Failure to do so may cause the vehicle to roll backwards and may result in a collision or serious personal injury.
- · The hill start assist may not prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on a hill under all load or road conditions. Always be prepared to depress the brake pedal to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards. Failure to do so may result in a collision or serious personal injury.

The hill start assist system automatically keeps the brakes applied to help prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards in the time it takes the driver to release the brake pedal and apply the accelerator when the vehicle is stopped on a hill.

Hill start assist will operate automatically under the following conditions:

- · The shift lever is placed in the D (Drive), B mode, or R (Reverse) position.
- · The vehicle is stopped completely on a hill by applying the brake.

The maximum holding time is 2 seconds. After 2 seconds the vehicle will begin to roll back and hill start assist will stop operating completely.

Hill start assist will not operate when the shift position is placed in the N (Neutral) or P (Park) position or on a flat and level road.

## REAR SONAR SYSTEM (RSS)

<!-- image -->

The RSS sounds a tone to inform the driver of obstacles near the bumper.

When the 'DISPLAY' key is ON, the sonar view will automatically appear in the in the touch-screen display. An additional view of the sonar status will appear in the vehicle information display for reference.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · The RSS is a convenience but it is not a substitute for proper parking.
- · The driver is always responsible for safety during parking and other maneuvers. Always look around and check that it is safe to do so before parking.
- · Read and understand the limitations of the RSS as contained in this section. The colors of the sonar indicator and the distance guide lines in the rear view indicate different distances to the object.
- · Inclement weather or ultrasonic sources such as an automatic car wash,atruck'scompressed-airbrakes or a pneumatic drill may affect the function of the system; this may include reduced performance or a false activation.
- · This function is designed as an aid to the driver in detecting large stationary objects to help avoid damaging the vehicle.
- · The system is not designed to prevent contact with small or moving objects.

Always move slowly. The system will not detect small objects below the bumper, and may not detect objects close to the bumper or on the ground.

- · The system may not detect the following objects: fluffy objects such as snow, cloth, cotton, glass, wool, etc., and thin objects such as rope, wire and chain, etc., or wedge-shaped objects.

If your vehicle sustains damage to the rear bumper fascia, leaving it misaligned or bent, the sensing zone may be altered causing inaccurate measurement of obstacles or false alarms.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

- · Excessive noise (such as audio system volume or an open vehicle window) will interfere with the tone and it may not be heard.
- · Keep the sonar sensors (located on the bumper fascia) free from snow, ice and large accumulations of dirt. Do not clean the sensors with sharp objects. If the sensors are covered, the accuracy of the sonar function will be diminished.

## SYSTEM OPERATION

The system informs with a visual and audible alert of rear obstacles when the shift lever is in the R (Reverse) position.

## COLD WEATHER DRIVING

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

To prevent damage to the Li-ion battery: Do not store the vehicle in temperatures below -13°F (-25°C) for over seven days. If the outside temperature is -13°F (-25°C) or less, the Li-ion battery mayfreezeanditcannotbechargedor provide power to run the vehicle. Move the vehicle to a warm location.

## NOTE:

- · Connect the charger to the vehicle and place the power switch in the OFF position when parking the vehicle if temperatures may go below -4°F (-20°C). For models with 40 kWh battery model, this provides external power to the Liion battery warmer (if so equipped) when it operates and does not dischargetheLi-ionbattery.Vehicle driving range is reduced if the Li-ion battery warmer (if so equipped) operates (Li-ion battery temperature approximately -4°F (-20°C) or colder) while driving the vehicle. You may need to charge the Li-ion battery sooner than in warmer temperatures.
- · The Li-ion battery requires more time to charge when the Li-ion battery warmer (if so equipped) operates.
- · The predicted charging time displayed on the meter and navigation system (if so equipped) increases when the Li-ion battery warmer (if so equipped) operates.
- · Vehicle range may be substantially reducedinextremelycoldconditions (for example under -4°F (-20°C)).
- · Using the climate control system to heat the cabin when outside temperature is below 32°F (0°C) uses more electricity and affects vehicle range more than when using the heater when the temperature is above 32°F (0°C).
- · Climate control performance is reduced whenusingtheClimateCtrl.TimerorRemote Climate Control while the Li-ion battery warmer (if so equipped) operates (for models with 40 kWh battery model). Set only the charging timer [End Time] when charging in cold weather. The vehicle automatically determines when to start charging to fully charge the Li-ion battery, even if the Li-ion battery warmer operates. Charging ends before the set end time if the Li-ion battery is fully charged.

## FREEING A FROZEN DOOR LOCK

To prevent a door lock from freezing, apply deicer through the key hole. If the lock becomesfrozen,heatthekeybeforeinserting it into the key hole or use the remote keyless entry key fob.

## ANTIFREEZE

In the winter when it is possible that the outside temperature will drop below 32°F (0°C), check the antifreeze to ensure proper winter protection. For additional information, see 'Cooling system' (P. 8-5).

## 12-VOLT BATTERY

If the 12-volt battery is not fully charged during extremely cold weather conditions, the 12-volt battery fluid may freeze and damage the 12-volt battery. To maintain maximum efficiency, the 12-volt battery should be checked regularly. For additional information, see '12-volt battery' (P. 8-9).

## DRAINING OF COOLANT WATER

If the vehicle is to be left outside without antifreeze, drain the cooling system. Refill before operating the vehicle. For additional information, see 'Cooling system' (P. 8-5).

## TIRE EQUIPMENT

SUMMER tires have a tread designed to provide superior performance on dry pavement. However, the performance of these tires will be substantially reduced in snowy and icy conditions. If you operate your vehicle on snowy or icy roads, NISSAN recommends the use of MUD & SNOW or ALL SEASON tires on all four wheels. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for the tire type, size, speed rating and availability information.

For additional traction on icy roads, studded tires may be used. However, some U.S. states and Canadian provinces prohibit their use. Check local, state and provincial laws before installing studded tires.

## Skid and traction capabilities of studded snowtires, on wet or dry surfaces, may be poorer than that of non-studded snow tires.

Tire chains may be used. For additional information, see 'Tire chains' (P. 8-34).

## SPECIAL WINTER EQUIPMENT

It is recommended that the following items be carried in the vehicle during winter:

- · A scraper and stiff-bristled brush to remove ice and snow from the windows and wiper blades.
- · A shovel to dig the vehicle out of snowdrifts.
- · Extra windshield-washer fluid to refill the reservoir tank.

## DRIVING ON SNOW OR ICE

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Wet ice (32°F, 0°C and freezing rain), very cold snow or ice can be slick and very hard to drive on. The vehicle will have much less traction or 'grip' under these conditions. Try to avoid driving on wet ice until the road is salted or sanded.
- · Whatever the conditions, drive with caution. Accelerate and slow down with care. If accelerating too fast, the drive wheels will lose even more traction.
- · Allow more stopping distance under these conditions. Braking should be started sooner than on dry pavement.
- · Allow greater following distances on slippery roads.
- · Watch for slippery spots (glare ice). These may appear on an otherwise clear road in shaded areas. If a patch of ice is seen ahead, brake before reaching it. Try not to brake while on the ice, and avoid any sudden steering maneuvers.
- · Do not use cruise control on slippery roads.

## FREEING A FROZEN CHARGE PORT LID

Whenthechargeportisfrozen,melt the ice using a hair dryer.

## PARKING BRAKE

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

- · When parking in an area where the outside temperature is below 32°F (0°C), the parking brake, if applied, mayfreeze in place and may be difficult to release.
- · For safe parking, it is recommended that you place the vehicle in the P (Park) position and securely block the wheels.

## FLAT TIRE

## TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (TPMS)

This vehicle is equipped with TPMS. It monitors tire pressure of all tires. When the low tire pressure warning light is lit, and the 'Tire Pressure Low - Add Air' warning appears on the vehicle information display, one or more of your tires is significantly underinflated. If the vehicle is being driven with lowtire pressure, the TPMS will activate and warn you of it by the low tire pressure warning light. This system will activate only whenthe vehicle is driven at speeds above 16 mph (25 km/h). For additional information, see 'Warning lights, indicator lights and audible reminders' (P. 2-14) and 'Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)' (P. 5-4).

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Radio waves could adversely affect electric medical equipment. Those who use a pacemaker should contact theelectric medical equipment manufacturer for the possible influences before use.
- · If the low tire pressure warning light illuminates while driving, avoid sudden steering maneuvers or abrupt braking, reduce vehicle speed, pull off the road to a safe location and stop the vehicle as soon as possible. Driving with underinflated tires may permanently damage the tires and increase the likelihood of tire failure. Serious vehicle damage could occur and may lead to an accident and could result in serious personal injury. Check the tire pressure for all four tires. Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended COLD tire pressure shown on the Tire and Loading Information label to turn the low tire pressure warning light OFF. If the light still illuminates while driving after adjusting the tire pressure, a tire maybeflat or the TPMS may be malfunctioning. If you have a flat tire, repair it as soon as possible. If no tire is flat and all tires are properly inflated, havethevehiclechecked.It is recommended that you visit a certified LEAF dealer for this service.

- · When using a wheel without the TPMSsuchasthesparetire,theTPMS will not function and the low tire pressure warning light will flash for approximately1minute.Thelightwill remain on after 1 minute. Have your tires replaced and/or TPMS system reset as soon as possible. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for these services.
- · Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS.
- · The Genuine NISSAN Emergency Tire Repair Sealant or equivalent can be used for temporarily repairing a tire. Do not inject any other tire liquid or aerosol tire sealant into the tires, as this may cause a malfunction of tire pressure sensors.
- · NISSAN recommends using only Genuine NISSAN Emergency Tire Sealant provided with your vehicle. Other tire sealants may damage the valve stem seal which can cause the tire to

- lose air pressure. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer as soon as possible after using tire repair sealant (for models equipped with the emergency tire puncture repair kit).

## REPAIRING FLAT TIRE

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · After using Genuine NISSAN EmergencyTireSealanttorepairaminortire puncture, do not drive the vehicle at speeds faster than 50 mph (80 km/h).
- · Immediately after using the Genuine NISSAN Emergency Tire Sealant to repair a minor tire puncture, it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer. The Genuine NISSAN Emergency Tire Sealant cannot permanently seal a punctured tire. Continuing operation of the vehicle without a permanent tire repair can lead to a crash.
- · If you used the Genuine NISSAN Emergency Tire Sealant to repair a minor tire puncture, it is recommended that youvisitaNISSANcertifiedLEAFdealer to replace the TPMS sensor in addition to repairing or replacing the tire.
- · NISSAN recommends using only Genuine NISSAN Emergency Tire Sealant provided with your vehicle. Other tire sealants may damage the valve stem seal which can cause the tire to lose air pressure.

This vehicle does not have a spare tire. The emergency tire puncture repair kit (Genuine NISSAN Emergency Tire Sealant) is supplied with the vehicle instead of a spare tire. It can be used to temporarily repair minor tire punctures.

If possible, have the vehicle towed to a facility that can repair or replace the flat tire. Using the emergency tire puncture repair kit may cause a malfunction of the tire pressure sensor and cause the low tire pressure warning light to illuminate.

## CLEANING EXTERIOR

In order to maintain the appearance of your vehicle, it is important to take proper care of it.

To protect the paint surfaces, wash your vehicle as soon as you can:

- · After a rainfall to prevent possible damage from acid rain.
- · After driving on coastal roads.
- · When contaminants such as soot, bird droppings, tree sap, metal particles or bugs get on the paint surface.
- · When dust or mud builds up on the surface.

Whenever possible, store or park your vehicle inside a garage or in a covered area.

Whenitisnecessarytoparkoutside,parkin a shady area or protect the vehicle with a body cover.

## Be careful not to scratch the paint surface when putting on or removing the body cover.

## WASHING

Wash dirt off the vehicle with a wet sponge and plenty of water. Clean the vehicle thoroughly using a mild soap, a special vehicle

soap or general purpose dishwashing liquid mixed with clean, lukewarm (never hot) water.

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

- · Do not concentrate water spray directly on the sonar sensors (if so equipped) on the bumper as this will result in damage to the sensors. Do not use pressure washers capable of spraying water over 1,200 psi (8,274 kPa) to wash your vehicle. Use of high-pressure washers over 1,200 psi (8,274 kPa) can result in damage to or removal of paint or graphics. Avoid using a high-pressure washer closer than 12 inches (30 cm) to the vehicle. Always use a wide-angle nozzle only, keep the nozzle moving and do not concentrate the water spray on any one area.
- · Do not use car washes that use acid in the detergent. Some car washes, especially brushless ones, use some acid for cleaning. The acid may react with some plastic vehicle components, causing them to crack. This could affect their appearance, and also could cause them not to func-
- on properly. Always check with your car wash to confirm that acid is not used.
- · Do not wash the vehicle with strong householdsoap,strongchemicaldetergents, gasoline or solvents.
- · Donotwashthevehicleindirectsunlight or while the vehicle body is hot, as the surface may become waterspotted.
- · Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, such as washing mitts. Care must be taken when removing caked-on dirt or other foreign substances so the paint surface is not scratched or damaged.

Rinse the vehicle thoroughly with plenty of clean water.

Inside flanges, seams and folds on the doors, hatches and hood are particularly vulnerable to the effects of road salt. Therefore, these areas must be regularly cleaned. Make sure that the drain holes in the lower edge of the door are open. Spray water under the body and in the wheel wells to loosen the dirt and wash away road salt.

Avoid leaving water spots on the paint surface by using a damp chamois to dry the vehicle.

## WAXING

Regular waxing protects the paint surface and helps retain new vehicle appearance. Polishing is recommended to remove built-up wax residue and to avoid a weathered appearance before reapplying wax.

A NISSAN certified LEAF dealer can assist you in choosing the proper product.

- · Wax your vehicle only after a thorough washing. Follow the instructions supplied with the wax.
- · Do not use a wax containing any abrasives, cutting compounds or cleaners that may damage the vehicle finish.

Machine compound or aggressive polishing on a base coat/clear coat paint finish may dull the finish or leave swirl marks.

## REMOVING SPOTS

Remove tar and oil spots, industrial dust, insects, and tree sap as quickly as possible from the paint surface to avoid lasting damageorstaining.Special cleaning products are available at a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer or any automotive accessory stores.

## UNDERBODY

In areas where road salt is used in winter, the underbody must be cleaned regularly. This will prevent dirt and salt from building up and causing the acceleration of corrosion on the underbody and suspension. Before the winter period and again in the spring, the underseal must be checked and, if necessary, re-treated.

## GLASS

Use glass cleaner to remove smoke and dust film from the glass surfaces. It is normal for glass to become coated with a film after the vehicle is parked in the hot sun. Glass cleaner and a soft cloth will easily remove this film.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

When cleaning the inside of the windows, do not use sharp-edged tools, abrasive cleaners or chlorine-based disinfectant cleaners. They could damage the electrical conductors, radio antenna elements or rear window defroster elements.

## WHEELS

Washthewheelswhenwashingthevehicle to maintain their appearance.

- · Clean the inner side of the wheels when the wheel is changed or the underside of the vehicle is washed.
- · Inspect wheel rims regularly for dents or corrosion. Such damage may cause loss of pressure or poor seal at the tire bead.
- · NISSAN recommendsthattheroadwheels be waxed to protect against road salt in areas where it is used during winter.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

Do not use abrasive cleaners when washing the wheels.

## ALUMINUM ALLOY WHEELS (if so equipped)

Washregularlywithaspongedampenedin a mild soap solution, especially during winter months in areas where road salt is used. Salt could discolor the wheels if not removed.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

Follow the directions below to avoid staining or discoloring the wheels:

- · Donotuseacleanerthatusesstrong acid or alkali contents to clean the wheels.
- · Do not apply wheel cleaners to the wheels when they are hot. The wheel temperature should be the same as ambient temperature.
- · Rinse the wheel to completely remove the cleaner within 15 minutes after the cleaner is applied.

## CHROME PARTS

Clean chrome parts regularly with a nonabrasive chrome polish to maintain the finish.

## TIRE DRESSING

NISSAN does not recommend the use of tire dressings. Tire manufacturers apply a coating to the tires to help reduce discoloration of the rubber. If a tire dressing is applied to the tires, it may react with the coating and form a compound.This compound may come off the tire while driving and stain the vehicle paint.

If you choose to use a tire dressing, take the following precautions:

- · Use a water-based tire dressing. The coating on the tire dissolves more easily with an oil-based tire dressing.
- · Apply a light coat of tire dressing to help prevent it from entering the tire tread/ grooves (where it would be difficult to remove).
- · Wipe off excess tire dressing using a dry towel. Make sure the tire dressing is completely removed from the tire tread/ grooves.
- · Allow the tire dressing to dry as recommendedbythetiredressingmanufacturer.

## CLEANING INTERIOR

Occasionally remove loose dust from the interior trim, plastic parts and seats using a vacuum cleaner or soft bristled brush. Wipe the vinyl and leather surfaces (if so equipped) with a clean, soft cloth dampened in mild soap solution, then wipe clean with a dry soft cloth.

Regular care and cleaning is required in order to maintain the appearance of the leather (if so equipped).

Before using any fabric protector, read the manufacturer's recommendations. Some fabric protectors contain chemicals that may stain or bleach the seat material.

Use a cloth dampened only with water to clean the meter and gauge lens.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Donotusewaxorsiliconebasedproductsintheinteriorofthevehicle.Doing so may cause damage to interior parts, electrical devices, or electronics.
- · Do not use water or acidic cleaners (hot steam cleaners) on the seat.This can damage the seat or occupant classification sensor (weight sensor). This can also affect the operation of the air bag system and result in serious personal injury.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

- · Never use benzine, thinner, or any similar material.
- · Small dirt particles can be abrasive and damaging to the leather surfaces (if so equipped) and should be removed promptly. Do not use saddle soap, car waxes, polishes, oils, cleaning fluids, solvents, detergents or ammonia-basedcleanersastheymay damage the leather's natural finish.
- · Never use fabric protectors unless recommended by the manufacturer.
- · Donotuseglassorplastic cleaner on meter or gauge lens covers. It may damage the lens cover.
- · Never use chloride solutions for cleaning aluminum decoratives (if so equipped), damage may occur.

## AIR FRESHENERS

Most air fresheners use a solvent that could affect the vehicle interior. If you use an air freshener, take the following precautions:

- · Hanging-type air fresheners can cause permanent discoloration when they contact vehicle interior surfaces. Place the air freshener in a location that allows it to hang free and not contact an interior surface.
- · Liquid-type air fresheners typically clip on the vents. These products can cause immediate damage and discoloration when spilled on interior surfaces.

Carefully read and follow the manufacturer's instructions before using air fresheners.

FLOOR MATS (if so equipped)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

To avoid potential pedal interference that may result in a collision, injury or death:

- · NEVER place a floor mat on top of another floor mat in the driver front position or install them upside down or backwards.
- · Use only Genuine NISSAN floor mats, or equivalent floor mats, that are specifically designed for use in your vehicle model and model year.

- · Properlypositionthematsinthefloorwell using the floor mat positioning hook. For additional information, see "Floor mat installation" (P. 7-6).
- · Make sure the floor mat does not interfere with pedal operation.
- · Periodically check the floor mats to make sure they are properly installed.
- · After cleaning the vehicle interior, check the floor mats to make sure they are properly installed.

The use of Genuine NISSAN floor mats can extend the life of your vehicle carpet and make it easier to clean the interior. Mats should be maintained with regular cleaning and replaced if they become excessively worn.

## Floor mat installation

Your vehicle is equipped with floor mat positioning hook(s).The number and shape of the floor mat positioning hooks for each seating position varies depending on the vehicle.

Wheninstalling Genuine NISSAN floor mats, follow the installation instructions provided with the mat and the following:

- 1. Position the floor mat in the floorwell so that the floor mat grommet holes are aligned with the hook(s).
- 2. Secure the grommet holes into the hook(s) and ensure that the floor mat is properly positioned.
- 3. Make sure the floor mat does not interfere with pedal operation. With the power switch in the OFF position, the selector lever in the P (Park) position fully apply andreleaseallpedals.Thefloormatmust not interfere with pedal operation or prevent the pedal from returning to its normal position.

It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for details about installing the floor mats in your vehicle.

Positioning hooks

The illustration shows the location of floor mat positioning hooks.

## SEAT BELTS

The seat belts can be cleaned by wiping them with a sponge dampened in a mild soap solution. Allow the belts to dry completely in the shade before using them.

For additional information, see 'Seat belts' (P. 1-10).

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Do not allow wet seat belts to roll up in the retractor. NEVER use bleach, dye, or chemical solvents to clean the seat belts, since these materials may severely weaken the seat belt webbing.

## CORROSION PROTECTION

## MOST COMMON FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO VEHICLE CORROSION

- · The accumulation of moisture-retaining dirt and debris in body panel sections, cavities, and other areas.
- · Damage to paint and other protective coatings caused by gravel and stone chips or minor traffic accidents.

## ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THE RATE OF CORROSION

## Moisture

Accumulation of sand, dirt and water on the vehicle body underside can accelerate corrosion. Wet floor coverings will not dry completely inside the vehicle, and should be removed for drying to avoid floor panel corrosion.

## Relative humidity

Corrosion will be accelerated in areas of high relative humidity, especially those areas where the temperatures stay above freezing, where atmospheric pollution exists, or where road salt is used.

## Temperature

A temperature increase will accelerate the rate of corrosion to those parts which are not well ventilated.

## Air pollution

Industrial pollution, the presence of salt in the air in coastal areas, or heavy road salt use will accelerate the corrosion process. Road salt will also accelerate the disintegration of paint surfaces.

## PROTECT YOUR VEHICLE FROM CORROSION

- · Wash and wax your vehicle often to keep the vehicle clean.
- · Always check for minor damage to the paint and repair it as soon as possible.
- · Keep drain holes at the bottom of the doors open to avoid water accumulation.
- · Check the underbody for accumulation of sand, dirt or salt. If present, wash with water as soon as possible.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

- · NEVERremovedirt,sandorotherdebris from the passenger compartment by washing it out with a hose. Remove dirt with a vacuum cleaner.
- · Never allow water or other liquids to comeincontactwithelectronic components inside the vehicle as this maydamagethem.

Chemicals used for road surface deicing are extremely corrosive. They accelerate corrosion and deterioration of underbody components such as the brake lines, brake cables, floor pan and fenders.

## In winter, the underbody must be cleaned periodically.

For additional protection against rust and corrosion, which may be required in some areas, it is recommended that you consult a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer.

TIRE PRESSURE

Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Radiowavescouldadverselyaffect electric medical equipment. Those who use a pacemaker should contact the electric medical equipment manufacturer for the possible influences before use.

This vehicle is equipped with the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). It monitors tire pressure of all tires. When the low tire pressure warning light is lit, and the 'Tire Pressure Low - Add Air' warning appears on the vehicle information display, one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated.

TheTPMSwill activate only when the vehicle is driven at speeds above 16 mph (25 km/h). Also, this system maynotdetect a sudden drop in tire pressure (for example a flat tire while driving).

For additional information, see 'Low tire pressure warning light' (P. 2-21), 'Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)' (P. 5-4) and 'Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)' (P. 6-3).

## Tire inflation pressure

Check the pressure of the tires often and always prior to long distance trips. The recommended tire pressure specifications are shown on the F.M.V.S.S/C.M.V.S.S certification label or Tire and Loading Information label under the 'Cold Tire Pressure' heading. The Tire and Loading Information label is affixed to the

driver side center pillar. Tire pressures should be checked regularly because:

- · Most tires naturally lose air over time.
- · Tires can lose air suddenly when driven over potholes or other objects or if the vehicle strikes a curb while parking.

The tire pressures should be checked when the tires are cold. The tires are considered COLD after the vehicle has been parked for 3 or morehours,ordrivenlessthan1mile (1.6 km) at moderate speeds.

The TPMS with Easy-Fill Tire Alert also provides visual and audible signals outside the vehicle for inflating the tires to the recommended COLD tire pressure. For additional information, see 'TPMS with Easy-Fill Tire Alert' (P. 5-7).

Incorrect tire pressure, including under inflation, may adversely affect tire life and vehicle handling.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Improperly inflated tires can fail suddenlyandcauseanaccident.
- · The Gross Vehicle Weight rating (GVWR) is located on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S certification label. The vehicle weight capacity is indicated on the Tire and Loading Information label. Do not load your vehicle beyond this capacity. Overloading your vehicle may result in reduced tire life, unsafe operating conditions due to premature tire failure, or unfavorable handling characteristics and could also lead to a serious accident. Loading beyond the specified capacity may also result in failure of other vehicle components.
- · Before taking a long trip, or whenever you heavily load yourvehicle,use a tire pressure gauge to ensure that the tire pressures are at the specified level.
- · For additional information regarding tires, refer to 'Important Tire Safety Information' (US) or 'Tire Safety Information' (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.

## Tire and Loading Information label

O 1 Seating capacity: The maximum number of occupants that can be seated in the vehicle.

O 2 Original size: The size of the tires originally installed on the vehicle at the factory.

- O 3 Cold tire pressure: Inflate the tires to this pressure when the tires are cold. Tires are considered COLD after the vehicle has been parked for 3 or more hours, or driven less than 1 mile (1.6 km) at moderate speeds. Therecommendedcoldtireinflation is set by the manufacturer to provide the best balance of tire wear, vehicle handling, driveability, tire noise, etc., up to the vehicle's GVWR.

Checking tire pressure

- 1. Remove the valve stem cap from the tire.
- 2. Press the pressure gauge securely onto the valve stem. Do not press too hard or force the valve stem sideways, otherwise air will escape. If the hissing sound of air escaping from the tire is heard while checking the pressure, reposition the gauge to eliminate this leakage.
- 3. Remove the gauge.
- 4. Read the tire pressure on the gauge stem and compare it to the specification shown on the Tire and Loading Information label.
- 5. Add air to the tire as necessary. If too much air is added, press the core of the valve stem briefly with the tip of the gauge stem to release pressure. Recheck the pressure and add or release air as necessary.
- 6. Install the valve stem cap.
- 7. Check the pressure of all of the tires.

## TIRE LABELING

Federal law requires tire manufacturers to place standardized information on the sidewall of all tires. This information identifies and describes the fundamental characteristics of the tire and also provides the Tire Identification Number (TIN) for safety standard certification. The TIN can be used to identify the tire in case of a recall.

<!-- image -->

## Example

O 1

Tire size (example: P215/65R15 95H)

- 1. P: The 'P' indicates the tire is designedforpassengervehicles(not all tires have this information).
- 2. Three-digit number (215): This number gives the width in millimeters of the tire from sidewall edge to sidewall edge.

- 3. Two-digit number (65): This number, known as the aspect ratio, gives the tire's ratio of height to width.
- 4. R: The 'R' stands for radial.
- 5. Two-digit number (15): This numberis the wheel or rim diameter in inches.
- 6. Two- or three-digit number (95): This number is the tire's load index. It is a measurement of how much weight each tire can support.
- 7. H: Tire speed rating. You should not drive the vehicle faster than the tire speed rating.

<!-- image -->

## Example (Type A) (if so equipped)

O 2 TIN (Tire Identification Number) for a new tire (example: DOT XX XX XXX XXXX)

- 1. DOT: Abbreviation for the 'Department Of Transportation'. The symbol can be placed above, below or to the left of the Tire Identification Number.
- 2. Two-digit code: Manufacturer's identification mark.
- 3. Two-digit code: Tire size.
- 4. Three-digit code: Tire type code (Optional).
- 5. Four numbers represent the week and year the tire was built. For example, the numbers 3103 means the 31st week of 2003. If these numbers are missing then look on the other sidewall of the tire.

<!-- image -->

## Example (Type B) (if so equipped)

O 2 TIN (Tire Identification Number) for a new tire (example: DOT XXX XXXXXX XXXX)

- 1. DOT: Abbreviation for the 'Department Of Transportation'. The symbol can be placed above, below or to the left or right of the Tire Identification Number.

- 2. Three-digit code: Manufacturer's identification mark.
- 3. Six-digit code: Descriptive code used to identify significant characteristics of the tire.
- 4. Four numbers represent the week and year the tire was built. For example, the numbers 3103 means the 31st week of 2003.

## O 3 Tire ply composition and material

The number of layers or plies of rubber-coated fabric in the tire. Tire manufacturers also must indicate thematerialsinthetire,whichinclude steel, nylon, polyester and others.

O 4 Maximum permissible inflation pressure

This number is the greatest amount of air pressure that should be put in thetire. Do not exceed the maximum permissible inflation pressure.

## O 5 Maximum load rating

This number indicates the maximumload in kilograms and pounds that can be carried by the tire. When replacing the tires on the vehicle, always use a tire that has the same load rating as the factory installed tire.

<!-- image -->

Term of 'tubeless' or 'tube type'

Indicates whether the tire requires an inner tube ('tube type') or not ('tubeless').

<!-- image -->

## The word 'radial'

The word 'radial' is shown if the tire has radial structure.

<!-- image -->

Manufacturer or brand name

Manufacturer or brand name is shown.

## Other Tire-related Terminology

In addition to the many terms that are defined throughout this section, Intended Outboard Sidewall is (1) the sidewall that contains a whitewall, bears white lettering or bears manufacturer, brand, and/or model name molding that is higher or deeper than the same molding on

the other sidewall of the tire, or (2) the outward facing sidewall of an asymmetricaltire that has a particular side that must always face outward when mounted on a vehicle.

## TYPES OF TIRES

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · When changing or replacing tires, be sure all four tires are of the same type (Example: Summer, All Season or Snow) and construction. A NISSAN certified LEAF dealer may be able to help you with information about tire type, size, speed rating and availability.
- · Always use tires of the same type, size, brand, construction and tread pattern on all four wheels. Failure to do so may result in a circumference difference between tires on the front and rear axles which can cause the VDC system to malfunction resulting in personal injury or death, excessive tie wear and may damage the transmission and differential gears.
- · Replacement tires may have a lower speed rating than the factory equipped tires, and may not match the potential maximum vehicle speed. Never exceed the maximum speed rating of the tire.
- · Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS.
- · For additional information regarding tires, refer to 'Important Tire Safety Information' (US) or 'Tire Safety Information' (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.

## All season tires

NISSAN specifies all season tires on some models to provide good performance all year, including snowy and icy road conditions. All Season tires are identified by ALL SEASON and/or M&S (Mud and Snow) on the tire sidewall. Snow tires have better snow traction than All Season tires and may be more appropriate in some areas.

## Summer tires

NISSAN specifies summer tires on some models to provide superior performance on dry roads. Summer tire performance is substantially reduced in snow and ice. Summer tires do not have the tire traction rating M&S on the tire sidewall.

If you plan to operate your vehicle in snowy or icy conditions, NISSAN recommends the useofSNOWtiresorALLSEASONtiresonall four wheels.

## Snow tires

If snow tires are needed, it is necessary to select tires equivalent in size and load rating to the original equipment tires. If you do not, it can adversely affect the safety and handling of your vehicle.

Generally, snow tires will have lower speed ratings than factory equipped tires and may not match the potential maximum vehicle speed. Never exceed the maximum speed rating of the tire.

If you install snow tires, they must be the same size, brand, construction and tread pattern on all four wheels.

For additional traction on icy roads, studded tires may be used. However, some U.S. states and Canadian provinces prohibit their use. Check local, state and provincial laws before installing studded tires. Skid and traction capabilities of studded snow tires, on wet or dry surfaces, may be poorer than that of non-studded snow tires.

## TIRE CHAINS

Use of tire chains may be prohibited according to location. Check the local laws before installing tire chains. When installing tire chains, make sure they are the proper size for the tires on your vehicle and are installed according to the chain manufacturer's suggestions.

Use only SAE Class S chains. Class 'S' chains are used on vehicles with restricted tire to vehicle clearance. Vehicles that can use Class 'S' chains are designed to meet the SAE standard minimum clearances between the tire and the closest vehicle suspension or body component required to accommodate the use of a winter traction device (tire chains or cables). The minimumclearancesaredeterminedusingthe factory equipped tire size. Other types may damage your vehicle.

Use chain tensioners when recommended by the tire chain manufacturer to ensure a tight fit. Loose end links of the tire chain must be secured or removed to prevent the possibility of whipping action damage to the fenders or underbody. If possible, avoid fully loading your vehicle when using tire chains. In addition, drive at a reduced speed. Otherwise, your vehicle may be damaged and/or vehicle handling and performance may be adversely affected.

## Tire chains must be installed only on the front wheels and not on the rear wheels.

Do not use tire chains on dry roads. Driving with tire chains in such conditions can causedamagetothevariousmechanisms of the vehicle due to some overstress.

## CHANGING WHEELS AND TIRES

## Tire rotation

NISSAN recommends rotating the tires every 7,500 miles (12,000 km).

As soon as possible, tighten the wheel nuts to the specified torque using a torque wrench.

Wheel nut tightening torque: 90 ft-lb (122 N·m)

Tire wear and damage

- · 1 Wear indicator
- · 2 Wear indicator location mark

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Tires should be periodically inspected for wear, cracking, bulging or objects caught in the tread. If excessive wear,

The wheel nuts must be kept tightened to the specification at all times. It is recommended that wheel nuts be tightened to the specification at each tire rotation interval.

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

- · After rotating the tires, check and adjust the tire pressure.
- · Retighten the wheel nuts when the vehicle has been driven for 600 miles (1,000 km) (also in cases of a flat tire, etc.).
- · For additional information regarding tires, refer to 'Important Tire Safety Information' (US) or 'Tire Safety Information' (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.
- cracks, bulging or deep cuts are found, the tire(s) should be replaced.
- · The original tires have built-in tread wear indicators. When wear indicators are visible, the tire(s) should be replaced.
- · Tires degrade with age and use. Have tires, over 6 years old checked by a qualified technician, because some tire damage may not be obvious. Replace the tires as necessary to prevent tire failure and possible personal injury.
- · For additional information regarding tires, refer to 'Important Tire Safety Information' (US) or 'Tire Safety Information' (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.

## Replacing wheels and tires

When replacing a tire, use the same size, tread design, speed rating and load carrying capacity as originally equipped. For additional information, see 'Wheels and tires' (P. 10-5) for recommended types and sizes of tires and wheels.

## WARNING

<!-- image -->

- · The use of tires other than those recommended or the mixed use of tires of different brands, construction (bias, bias-belted or radial), or tread patterns can adversely affect the ride, braking, handling, Vehicle DynamicControl(VDC)system,ground clearance, body-to-tire clearance, tire chain clearance, speedometer calibration, headlight aim and bumper height. Some of these effects may lead to accidents and could result in serious personal injury.
- · If your vehicle was originally equipped with four tires that were the same size and you are only replacing two of the four tires, install thenewtiresontherearaxle.Placing
- newtiresonthefrontaxlemaycause lossofvehiclecontrolinsomedriving conditions and cause an accident and personal injury.
- · If the wheels are changed for any reason, always replace with wheels which have the same off-set dimension. Wheels of a different off-set could cause premature tire wear, degrade vehicle handling characteristics, affect the VDC system and/or interference with the brake discs. Such interference can lead to decreased braking efficiency and/or early brake pad/shoe wear. For additional information on wheel-off set dimensions, see 'Wheels and tires' (P. 10-5).
- · When using a wheel without the TPMSsuchasthesparetire,theTPMS will not function when a wheel is replaced, the TPMS will not function and the low tire pressure warning light will flash for approximately 1 minute. The light will remain on after 1 minute. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.
- · Replacing tires with those not originally specified by NISSAN could affect the proper operation of the TPMS.
- · TheTPMSsensormaybedamagedif it is not handled correctly. Be careful when handling the TPMS sensor.
- · When replacing the TPMS sensor, the ID registration may be required. It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for ID registration.
- · Do not use a valve stem cap that is not specified by NISSAN. The valve stem cap may become stuck.
- · Be sure that the valve stem caps are correctly fitted. Otherwise the valve maybecloggedupwithdirtandcause a malfunction or loss of pressure.
- · Do not install a damaged or deformed wheel or tire even if it has been repaired. Such wheels or tires could have structural damage and could fail without warning.
- · The use of retread tire is not recommended.
- · For additional information regarding tires, refer to 'Important Tire Safety Information' (US) or 'Tire Safety Information' (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.

## Wheel balance

Unbalanced wheels may affect vehicle handling and tire life. Even with regular use, wheels can get out of balance. Therefore, they should be balanced as required.

## Wheel balance service should be performed with the wheels off the vehicle. Spin balancing the wheels on the vehicle could lead to mechanical damage.

For additional information regarding tires, refer to 'Important Tire Safety Information' (US) or 'Tire Safety Information' (Canada) in the Warranty Information Booklet.

## Care of wheels

For additional information on care of wheels, see 'Cleaning exterior' (P. 7-2).

## EMERGENCY TIRE PUNCTURE REPAIR KIT

The emergency tire puncture repair kit (Emergency Tire Sealant) is supplied with the vehicle instead of a spare tire. It can be used to temporarily repair minor tire punctures.

If possible, have the vehicle towed to a facility that can repair or replace the flat tire. Using the emergency tire puncture repair kit may cause a malfunction of the tire pressure sensor and cause the low tire pressure warning light to illuminate.

For additional information, see 'Flat tire' (P. 6-3).

Electric shift P (Park) position mechanism: Onasteep hill check that the vehicle is held securely while the vehicle is in the P (Park) position without applying any brakes.

Parking brake: Check the parking brake operation regularly. The vehicle should be securely held on a steep hill with only the parking brake applied. If the parking brake cannot keep a vehicle position, it is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer for this service.

Seats: Check seat position controls such as seat adjusters, seatback recliner, etc., to ensure they operate smoothly and all latches lock securely in every position. Check that the head restraints/headrests moveupanddownsmoothlyandthelocks (if so equipped) hold securely in all latched positions.

Seat belts: Check that all parts of the seat belt system (for example, buckles, anchors, adjusters and retractors) operate properly and smoothly, and are installed securely. Check the belt webbing for cuts, fraying, wear or damage.

Steering wheel: Check for changes in the steering conditions, such as excessive free play, hard steering or strange noises.

Warning lights and chimes: Make sure all warning lights and chimes are operating properly.

Windshield defroster: Check that the air emits from the defroster outlets properly and in sufficient quantity when operating the heater or air conditioner.

Windshield wiper and washer*: Check that the wipers and washer operate properly and that the wipers do not streak.

## Under the hood and vehicle

The maintenance items listed here should be checked periodically.

12-volt battery (except for maintenance free batteries)*: Check the fluid level in each cell. The fluid should be at the bottom of the filler opening. Vehicles operated in high temperatures or under severe conditions require frequent checks of the 12-volt battery fluid level.

## NOTE:

## AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM REFRIGERANT AND LUBRICANT RECOMMENDATIONS

The air conditioning system in your NISSAN vehicle must be charged with the refrigerant, HFO-1234yf (R-1234yf), and the compressor oil, ND-OIL11 or equivalent.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

The use of any other refrigerant or oil will cause severe damage to the air conditioning system and will require the replacement of all air conditioner system components.

The refrigerant, HFO-1234yf (R-1234yf), in your NISSAN vehicle will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Although this refrigerant does not affect the earth's atmosphere, certain governmental regulations require the recovery and recycling of any refrigerant during automotive air conditioning system service. Air conditioner systemshouldonly be serviced by trained and certified technicians to ensure proper and safe operation (SAE J2845). A NISSAN certified LEAF dealer has the trained technicians and equipment needed to recover

and recycle your air conditioning system refrigerant. Only new and SAE J2842 certified evaporator(s) or inner condenser (if so equipped) shall be used as replacement parts.

A damaged or leaking air conditioning evaporator or inner condenser (if so equipped) shall never be repaired or replaced with one removed from a used or salvaged vehicle. To replace a damaged or leaking evaporator or inner condenser (if so equipped), use only new and SAE J2842 certified evaporator(s). It is recommended that you visit a NISSAN certified LEAF dealer when servicing your air conditioner system.

## VEHICLE LOADING INFORMATION

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · It is extremely dangerous to ride in the cargo area inside the vehicle. In a collision, people riding in these areas are more likely to be seriously injured or killed.
- · Do not allow people to ride in any area of your vehicle that is not equipped with seats and seat belts.
- · Be sure everyone in your vehicle is in a seat and using a seat belt properly.

## TERMS

It is important to familiarize yourself with the following terms before loading your vehicle:

- · Curb Weight (actual weight of your vehicle) - vehicle weight including: standard and optional equipment, fluids and emergency tools. This weight does not include passengers and cargo.
- · GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) - curb weight plus the combined weight of passengers and cargo.
- · GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) - maximum total combined weight of the unloaded vehicle, passengers, cargo, hitch, trailer tongue load and any other optional equipment. This information is located on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. label.
- · GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating) maximum weight (load) limit specified for the front or rear axle. This information is located on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. label.
- · Vehicle Capacity Weight, Load limit, Total load capacity - maximum total weight limit specified of the load (passengers and cargo) for the vehicle. This is the maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo that can be loaded into the vehicle. If the vehicle is used to tow a trailer, the trailer tongue weight must be included as part of the cargo load. This information is located on the Tire and Loading Information label.
- · Cargocapacity-permissible weight of cargo, the subtracted weight of occupants from the load limit.
- · GCWR (Gross Combined Weight Rating) - The maximum total weight rating of the vehicle, passengers, cargo, and trailer.

## VEHICLE LOAD CAPACITY

Before driving a loaded vehicle, confirm that you do not exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) or the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) for your vehicle. Both the GVWR and GAWR are located on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification label. For additional information, see 'Measurement of weights' (P. 10-14).

Do not exceed the load limit of your vehicle shown as 'The combined weight of occupants and cargo' on the Tire and Loading Information label. Do not exceed the number of occupants shown as 'Seating Capacity' on the Tire and Loading Information label.

To get 'the combined weight of occupants and cargo', add the weight of all occupants, then add the total cargo weight. Examples are shown in the following illustration.

Steps For Determining Correct Load Limit

<!-- image -->

- 1. Locate the statement 'The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.' on your vehicle's placard.
- 2. Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.
- 3. Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.
- 4. The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity. For example, if the 'XXX' amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb. passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400 - 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs.)
- 5. Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loadedonthevehicle.Thatweight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.
- 6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.

Towing a trailer with a vehicle that is notintendedfortowingmayresultin anaccident involving injury or death.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Do not tow a trailer with your vehicle. Towing a trailer may result in an accident involving injury or death.

Before driving a loaded vehicle, confirm that you do not exceed the (GVWR) or the (GAWR) for your vehicle. For additional information, see 'Measurement of weights' (P. 10-14).

Also check tires for proper inflation pressures. For additional information, see 'Tire and Loading Information label' (P. 10-9).

## LOADING TIPS

- · The GVW must not exceed the GVWR or GAWR as specified on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification label.
- · Do not load the front and rear axle to the GAWR. Doing so will exceed the GVWR.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- · Properly secure all cargo with ropes or straps to help prevent it from sliding or shifting. Do not place cargo higher than theseatbacks.Inasuddenstop or collision, unsecured cargo could cause personal injury.

- · Do not load your vehicle any heavier than the GVWR or the maximum front and rear GAWRs. If you do, parts of your vehicle can break, tire damage could occur, or it can change the way your vehicle handles. This could result in loss of control and cause personal injury.
- · Overloading not only can shorten the life of your vehicle and the tire, but can cause unsafe vehicle handling and longer braking distances. This may cause a premature tire failure, which could result in a serious accident and personal injury. Failures caused by overloading are not covered by the vehicle's warranty.

## MEASUREMENT OF WEIGHTS

Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts that could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the vehicle is loaded, drive to a scale and weigh the front and the rear wheels separately to determine axle loads. Individual axle loads should not exceed either of the Gross Axle Weight Ratings (GAWR). The total of the axle loads should not exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). These ratings are given on the vehicle certification label. If weight ratings are exceeded, move or remove items to bring all weights below the ratings.

## TOWING A TRAILER

Do not tow a trailer with your vehicle.

## FLAT TOWING

## UNIFORM TIRE QUALITY GRADING

Towing your vehicle with all four wheels on the ground is sometimes called flat towing. This method is typically used when towing a vehicle behind a recreational vehicle, such as a motor home.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

- · Failure to follow these guidelines can result in severe reduction gear damage.
- · DO NOT tow this vehicle with all four wheels on the ground (flat towing).
- · For emergency towing procedures see 'Towing your vehicle' (P. 6-13).

## NOTE:

## If the Li-ion battery becomes completely discharged:

- · The vehicle is automatically placed in the ON position and it will not be possible to switch to the READY to drive position.
- · The vehicle is automatically switched totheN(Neutral)positionanditwillnot be possible to drive the vehicle.

For additional information, see 'If the Li-ion battery becomes completely discharged' (P. 6-12).

DOT(Department Of Transportation) Quality Grades: All passenger car tires must conform to federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.

Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width. For example:

## Treadwear200TractionAATemperatureA

## TREADWEAR

The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half (1 1/2) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon actual conditions of their use however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate.

## TRACTION AA, A, B AND C

The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as

measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.

## TEMPERATURE A, B AND C

The temperature grades A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature cancausethematerialofthetiretodegenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperaturecanleadtosuddentirefailure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and possible tire failure.

While you are not required to allow such access and use, if you do not so agree NISSAN may be unable under applicable law to activate the vehicle telematics system in your vehicle, and certain features of your vehicle which are dependent on vehicle telematics will not operate as intended or designed. These may include features such as automatic charging station map updates, remote battery state of charge check, charging complete notice, remote

plug in reminder, remote charging on, remote climate control on, drive route planning, driving tips to improve range, driving history, billing simulation, ECO ranking, ECO forest, maintenance reminders, etc. Other features that may be developed and offered by NISSAN in the future may also not function without telematics data transmission.

NissanConnect® EV with Services powered by SiriusXM® are provided by NISSAN pursuant to a subscription services agreement covering your vehicle. This agreement is necessary for all owners. This agreement,andanexplanationofitsterms andconditions,can be found at the NISSAN Owner's Portal webpage. Further, the operator of the vehicle must also touch [OK] on the Navi screen to indicate assent each time he or she starts the car. If you decide at any time that you do not want your vehicle to transmit data to NISSAN, you can deactivate the telematics account associated with this vehicle by canceling the subscription services agreement by visiting the NISSAN Owner's Portal Webpage or calling NISSAN at 1-877-NOGASEV (1-877664-2738). The service can be reactivated later upon request if you choose. Simply visit the same website or call the number

above. Alternatively, you can turn off the transmission of certain categories of data through the use of settings found in the navigation system under Menu, NissanConnect® EV with Services powered by SiriusXM®, Vehicle Information Sharing with NISSAN. Note, turning off 'Vehicle Information Sharing with NISSAN' will only disable the automatic sharing of information at vehicle start-up. Certain categories of data may still be transmitted if vehicle telematics features are accessed either in the vehicle or remotely.

Your agreement to the transmission and use of data by NISSAN can be provided in various ways. The vehicle is equipped with a 'pop up' screen on the vehicle navigation systemthatwill ask for your consent to this data transfer. A version of the following message will appear: 'Pursuant to subscription agreement, your vehicle wirelessly transmits recorded vehicle data to NISSAN for various purposes, including NissanConnect® EV with Services powered by SiriusXM®, product evaluation, research and development. By touching OK, you consent to the transmission and use of your vehicle data. See Owner's Manual or NISSAN Owner's portal webpage for terms and details.' If you touch [OK], your vehicle

will transmit data as designed in connection with the vehicle telematics system. If you touch [Decline] your vehicle will not transmit data. However, the telematics features referenced above, and perhaps others, will not be available to you. The vehicle's static navigation system will remain operational, and you will be able to access your radio and climate controls.

Telematics features are dependent on cellular data transmission. Some areas may have limited or no cellular connectivity, resulting in a loss or interruption of data transmission and, as a result, certain features may be temporarily unavailable. Even if areas with good signal reception, cellular connectivity can be adversely affected by things such as tall buildings, apartments, tunnels, underground parking, mountainous areas, etc. Even if the signal strength bar of the in-vehicle data communication module indicates good reception, connectivity may be disrupted. This does not indicate a malfunction. Operate the system again after a few minutes to restore connectivity. NissanConnect® EV with Services powered by SiriusXM® features are offered as a convenience to the vehicle owner.

NISSAN is not responsible for, and owner assumes all risk of, interruptions in service or errors based on incomplete or inaccurate data. NissanConnect® EVwith Services powered by SiriusXM® communications may be received at a verified e-mail address or by SMS/text messaging-enabled mobile phone. Standard text rates and/or data usage may apply depending on your carrier.

If your vehicle's telematics account is active, and you are not the original owner, please contact NISSAN at the website or phone number above as soon as possible to update the telematics enrollment information. Upon sale of the vehicle, please contact NISSAN at the website or phone number above so that NISSAN's records may be updated. NissanConnect® EV with Services powered by SiriusXM® subscription services will automatically terminate at the end of the initial free term if you do not wish to renew your subscription agreement at the prices then in effect.

## EVENT DATA RECORDERS (EDR)

This vehicle is equipped with an Event Data Recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deploymentorhittingaroadobstacle,data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:

- · Howvarioussystemsinyourvehiclewere operating;
- · Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened;
- · How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,
- · How fast the vehicle was traveling.
- · Sounds are not recorded.

These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as

law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer and NISSAN certified LEAF dealer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment,can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.

EDR data will only be accessed with the consent of the vehicle owner or lessee or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

## ADDITIONAL DATA RECORDING (on vehicles equipped with optional ProPILOT Assist)

If your vehicle is equipped with the optional ProPILOT Assist, it will also be equipped with a supplemental vehicle data recording function.

The data recording function is designed to record such data as:

- · Driver operational status of accelerator, brakes, steering, etc.
- · Detection status of a vehicle ahead and lane markers
- · Vehicle information including distance to vehicle ahead and lateral position
- · Information on the operation of the ProPILOT Assist and other crash avoidance features
- · ProPILOT Assist malfunction diagnosis information
- · External images from multi-sensing front camera (Available only when SRS air bag or AEB with Pedestrian Detection system is activated)

ProPILOT Assist does not record conversations, sounds or images of the inside of the vehicle.

To read this vehicle data, special equipment is required and access to the vehicle or the recording unit is needed. This vehicle datawill only be accessed with the consent of the vehicle owner or lessee or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

If downloaded, NISSAN may use the data recorded for the purpose of improving NISSAN's vehicle safety performance.

NISSAN will not disclose/provide the recorded data to a third party except:

- · With the consent of the vehicle owner or with the consent of the lessee

- · In response to an official request from law enforcement, a court order, governmental agency, or other legally enforceable requests
- · For use as part of NISSAN's defense of litigation
- · For research purposes after the data is modified such that it is no longer tied to a specific vehicle or vehicle owner

If you have any questions regarding the data NISSAN may collect about you, please visit our Privacy Policy: https://www.nissanusa.com.
